This memorandum presents the data collection, analysis, and recommendations of a traffic
calming study prepared for Lincoln Avenue, in the City of El Cerrito, CA. Along Lincoln Avenue,
the project study area extends from Richmond Street to Ashbury Avenue. The study area is
shown on Figure 1.

The following pages present our findings for the neighborhood.


LINCOLN AVENUE

History and Background

Between Richmond Street and Ashbury Avenue, Lincoln Avenue is a 2-way local street, with a 25
mph posted speed limit. The roadway is 30 feet wide, with block lengths of roughly 250 feet.
Lincoln Avenue at Richmond Street is controlled with a side-street stop on Lincoln Avenue; a
raised crosswalk is provided on Richmond Street, on the south side of the intersection. The
remaining intersections along Lincoln Avenue ­ Everett Street, Norvell Street, Albermarle Street
and Clayton Avenue - are side-street stop controlled on the minor street approach.                      The t-
intersection of Lincoln Avenue/Ashbury Avenue is controlled with a side-street stop on Lincoln
Avenue. Yellow-striped crosswalks are provided on all legs of this intersection, as it provides
direct pedestrian access to El Cerrito High School.

The slope of the roadway is relatively flat as you progress west to east; near Albermarle Street the
grade of the roadway increases slightly up to the intersection with Clayton Avenue. From Clayton
Avenue, the roadway gently descends towards Ashbury Avenue. Sidewalks are provided on both
sides of Lincoln Avenue as is on-street parking. Lincoln Avenue is not an Emergency Response
Route, as identified in the City's Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan. It is a proposed Class III
Bicycle Route.

In 2010, the City of El Cerrito adopted the Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan, which
identifies a process through which a street may be evaluated for Traffic Control devices. If a street
or segment qualifies, various measures are presented to assist with traffic control related
concerns. For Lincoln Avenue, the study segment meets the NTMP criteria based on vehicle
speeds exceeding the posted speed limit by 3 mph (based on 2009 data) and the daily traffic
volumes exceeding 1,000 vehicles per day. The current ADT along Lincoln averages 1,500 vehicles
per day.


UNDERSTANDING OF TRAFFIC CONCERNS

In response to recent concerns and a petition from the neighborhood, the City has been studying
the Lincoln Avenue corridor, identifying current issues and presenting potential Tier 1 and Tier 2
measures, consistent with the Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan. Tier 1 measures include
enforcement, education and outreach, as well as engineering measures limited to striping,
signage, and pavement markings. Tier 2 measures are more physical elements, including speed
humps, traffic circles, raised intersections, roadway closures, and enhanced crosswalk systems.
Tier 1 measures are often recommended as a first step, and as more enforcement or adherence is
needed, Tier 2 measures are implemented.

The following concerns were raised by neighbors in a petition filed in 2011:

            ·    Speeding
            ·    High traffic volumes, especially during the peak commute periods
            ·    Limited visibility along Lincoln Avenue, mainly due to parked cars
            ·    Lack of motorist yielding to pedestrians
            ·    Unsafe conditions at the Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street intersection
            ·    Unsafe environment for multi-modal users due to the above concerns

The main focus of this traffic study is to presenting solutions that alleviate these concerns,
including "calming" traffic on the Lincoln Avenue corridor, and improving the walkability of the
corridor, providing a safer experience for pedestrians and residents.

Collision History

Fehr & Peers collected SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System) data to use in this
analysis. From a review of available data between 2007 and 2011, 13 collisions were reported
along this Lincoln Avenue Corridor. While there were a few reported sideswipe collisions on the
eastern portion of Lincoln Avenue, the following collisions occurred within the intersections:

    ·    6 collisions at Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street
              o     2 in 2007
              o     1 in 2008
              o     3 in 2009
    ·    1 collision at Lincoln Avenue/Albermarle Street (2007)
    ·    1 collision at Lincoln Avenue/Clayton Avenue (2007)
    ·    1 collisions at Lincoln Avenue/Ashbury Avenue (2010)

Of the 6 collisions at the Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street intersection, 5 pertain to collisions that
may be corrected with a traffic calming device (the remaining collision involved a hit-and-run with
alcohol as a factor).     4 of the 5 collisions that occurred at the intersection were broadside
collisions.   The remaining collision was occurred at night, and involved a pedestrian in the
crosswalk.

Volume Data

Fehr & Peers collected turning movement counts and 48-hour tube counts on Tuesday, April 24th,
when school was in session. Turning movement counts were conducted at the Lincoln
Avenue/Richmond Street intersection, between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM, to capture hours with the
highest number of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists.    48-hour tube counts were collected on
Albermarle Street, south of Lincoln Avenue, beginning on Tuesday, April 24th.

This traffic count data aided in the analysis of certain traffic control devices, including speed
humps and all-way stop signs. Per the criteria outlined in the NTMP, speed humps are not
recommended on roadways with volumes greater than 4,000 average daily trips (ADT); traffic
volumes on Lincoln Avenue are less than half of this criterion. Volumes collected in 2006

identified 1,560 ADT on Lincoln Avenue, just east of Richmond Street; 2009 counts on Lincoln
Avenue near Norvell Street averaged 1,540 ADT.

All-Way Stop Sign Warrants

The Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street and Lincoln Avenue/Albermarle Street intersections were
analyzed for all-way stop control. The NTMP proposes criteria for assessing if all-way stop control
should be installed at an intersection on a residential street, based on volumes (a combination of
vehicle and pedestrian), collision history, and visibility. Exceptions are granted to these criterion
based on the overall neighborhood circulation and special considerations. A street must meet
either the volume, collision history or visibility criterion (with or without the exceptions) to be
considered for an all-way stop control. These are briefly described below.

        Volume: The combined volume from all approaches must equal 300 units per hours for
        eight hours in one day, and that the minor street must equal one-third of the total
        entering volume, for the same eight hours of that day.

        Collision: The total number of reported collisions averages at least three or more per
        year, for at least two years. These collisions must be of the type that can be corrected by
        a multi-way stop sign.

        Visibility: If a significant visibility problem exists at an intersection for a travel distance of
        less than 150 feet, and cannot be corrected by other means (trimming vegetation).

                Neighborhood Circulation: Traffic volumes may be reduced by 60% for all the
                above values if the these three conditions are met: 1) neither street is an arterial
                street, 2) there is not a stop sign or traffic signal within 600 feet of the study
                intersection and 3) the stop sign installation is compatible with the overall traffic
                circulation within the neighborhood.

                Special Conditions: Traffic volumes may also be reduced to 60% of the overall
                values if other measures have not been effective in regulating crossing safety for
                pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorists within 600 feet of a school, park or playground,
                community facility, or on a steep grade.

For the Lincoln Avenue segment, the traffic volumes were reduced by 60% based on the
neighborhood circulation and special conditions criteria, with the street located near a school, and
Yvetteh Ortiz

the all-way stop control being consistent with the traffic flow and circulation of the
neighborhood.

Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street

The results of the volume data analysis indicate a much higher percentage of traffic on Richmond
Street than on Lincoln Avenue. With the 60% reductions in traffic permitted in the City's NTMP,
the intersection does not meet the criteria to install an all-way stop sign due to the large
difference in traffic volumes on the two streets. The minor street volume is still below the 1/3
criterion in the NTMP. It is important to note that where unwarranted, multi-way stop signs may
actually increase vehicle speeds, and may further decrease driver compliance. For these reasons,
other treatments should be considered before an all-way stop sign is installed at unwarranted
locations. Analysis results are presented in Appendix C.

The collision history criterion was not met at this intersection. Four accidents were reported in
2009; however only one accident was reported in 2008.            For the criteria to be met, three
accidents which could be corrected with a multi-way stop sign would need to occur within two
consecutive years.

The last criteria, visibility, point to areas where visibility may obstruct the driver's view of
oncoming traffic.    This intersection presents no visibility concerns that aren't corrected by
trimming trees or painting red curb to prohibit on-street parking near the intersection.

Lincoln Avenue/Albermarle Street

Albermarle Street is currently a side-street stop approach to Lincoln Avenue. This analysis looked
at the feasibility of installing a multi-way stop sign at this location. ADT's were already collected
along Lincoln Avenue in 2009; thus 48-hour tube counts were collected on Albermarle Street. The
tube counts were conducted just south of the Lincoln Avenue intersection and were conducted to
see how close the intersection may be to meeting the volume criteria.           If the volume data
indicated the intersection may be close to meeting the criteria, turning movement counts were to
be conducted at the intersection.

The volume data collected on Albermarle Street show significantly lower volumes than on Lincoln
Avenue. The ADT on Albermarle Street averaged 300 vehicles per day; on Lincoln Avenue, the
ADT's are roughly 1,500 vehicles per day. Based on this, it was determined that the intersection
Yvetteh Ortiz

would not meet the reduced volume criteria, and turning movement counts were not collected at
the intersection.

The Lincoln Avenue/Albermarle Avenue does not present visibility concerns that cannot be
corrected by no-parking zones or vegetation trimming.


RECOMMENDATIONS

The goal of this study is to present measures that address concerns voiced along Lincoln Avenue.
The City currently has approximately $25,000 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 improvements along Lincoln
Avenue.

The following table presents the Tier 1 and Tier 2 measures that could be considered along this
segment, along with their rough order of magnitude cost.

Based on the City's current budget for improvements along Lincoln Avenue, and the
recommended goals, the following combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 near-term measures are
suggested along Lincoln Avenue. These improvements are identified on Figure 2.

Recommended Near-Term Tier 1 Measures

    ·    Striped bulbouts at Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street, Lincoln Avenue/Norvell Street and
         Lincoln Avenue/Albermarle Street intersections
    ·    Centerline striping at Lincoln Avenue/Richmond Street
    ·    Red curb striping for 15 to 25 feet along Lincoln Avenue in advance of Richmond Street,
         Everett Street, Norvell Street, and Albermarle Street
    ·    A 15 mph School Speed Limit Zone sign between Clayton Avenue and Ashbury Avenue,

Recommended Near-Term Tier 2 Measures

    ·    A speed hump on Lincoln Avenue, between Everett Street and Norvell Street
    ·    A raised crosswalk across Lincoln Avenue at Albermarle Street

The approximate cost for these improvements is detailed below in Table 2.

While the above measures are proposed to calm traffic by reducing vehicle speeds on Lincoln
Avenue, they may also reduce vehicle volumes as well. Based on nationally-conducted traffic
calming evaluations, speed humps are shown to reduce vehicle volumes by approximately 20%.
This reduction in vehicle volumes on Lincoln Avenue may cause some vehicles to divert to other
parallel streets.
