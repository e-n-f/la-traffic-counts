The purpose of this memorandum is to present the initial results of the transportation and circulation
assessment for the proposed Mercy Housing project (79 senior residential units) to be located at 15888
Hesperian Boulevard in San Lorenzo, unincorporated Alameda County. This initial analysis focused on
the transportation-related impacts including safety, alternative modes of transportation, intersection
operations, vehicular access, parking and the potential increase in traffic associated with the proposed
project. The initial assessment was completed in accordance with guidelines established by Alameda
County and is consistent with standard traffic engineering techniques.

Study Area and Periods

The study area consists of the following three intersections:

Hesperian Boulevard/Grant Avenue is a four-legged, signalized intersection. The northbound and
southbound Hesperian Boulevard approaches have protected left-turn phasing. The east leg of this
intersection is the southbound on-ramp to Interstate 880 (I-880). Marked crosswalks and pedestrian
signal heads with push buttons are provided on all legs of the intersection except the north leg.

Hesperian Boulevard/Post Office Road is a signalized, tee intersection. The southbound Hesperian
Boulevard approach has protected left-turn phasing. Marked crosswalks and pedestrian signal heads
with push buttons are provided on the eastern and northern legs of the intersection.

Hesperian Boulevard/Paseo Grande is a signalized, four-legged intersection. The northbound and
southbound Hesperian Boulevard approaches have protected left-turn phasing, and the eastbound and
westbound Paseo Grande approaches each have an exclusive phase. Marked crosswalks and pedestrian
signals are provided on all legs of this intersection.

Operating conditions during typical weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods were evaluated to capture the
highest potential impacts for the proposed project as well as the highest volumes on the local
transportation network. The morning peak hour occurs between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. and reflects
conditions during the home to work or school commute, while the p.m. peak hour occurs between 4:00
and 6:00 p.m. and typically reflects the highest level of congestion during the homeward bound
commute.

Capacity Analysis

Intersection Level of Service Methodologies

Level of Service (LOS) is used to rank traffic operation on various types of facilities based on traffic
volumes and roadway capacity using a series of letter designations ranging from A to F. Generally, Level
of Service A represents free flow conditions and Level of Service F represents forced flow or
breakdown conditions. A unit of measure that indicates a level of delay generally accompanies the LOS
designation.

All the study intersections are controlled by traffic signals and were evaluated using the signalized
methodology published in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board, 2000.
from the HCM. This methodology is based on factors including traffic volumes, green time for each
movement, phasing, whether or not the signals are coordinated, truck traffic, and pedestrian activity.
Average stopped delay per vehicle in seconds is used as the basis for evaluation in this LOS
methodology. For purposes of this study, delays were calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software.

The ranges of delay associated with the various levels of service are indicated in Table 1.

                                              Table 1
                         Signalized Intersection Level of Service Criteria
LOS A Delay of 0 to 10 seconds. Most vehicles arrive during the green phase, so do not stop at all.
LOS B Delay of 10 to 20 seconds. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, but many drivers still do not
      have to stop.
LOS C Delay of 20 to 35 seconds. The number of vehicles stopping is significant, although many still
      pass through without stopping.
LOS D Delay of 35 to 55 seconds. The influence of congestion is noticeable, and most vehicles have to
      stop.
LOS E Delay of 55 to 80 seconds. Most, if not all, vehicles must stop and drivers consider the delay
      excessive.
LOS F Delay of more than 80 seconds. Vehicles may wait through more than one cycle to clear the
      intersection.

Traffic Operation Standards

The County Level of Service standard for intersections is LOS D or better during peak travel periods.
The project would have a significant traffic impact if project-generated traffic would cause an
intersection currently operating at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) during peak travel
periods to operate below the standard (LOS E or F). If the intersection currently operates below the
County standard (LOS E or F), the project would have a significant impact if:

•   The volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio increases by three percent or more; or
•   The average delay per vehicle increases by five seconds or more.

Existing Conditions

The Existing Conditions scenario provides an evaluation of current operation based on existing traffic
volumes during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. This condition does not include project-generated traffic
volumes. Traffic volume data was collected on a typical weekday in February 2014 and is attached for
reference.

Intersection Levels of Service

Under existing conditions, all of the study intersections are operating at an acceptable LOS C or better
during both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. A summary of the intersection level of service calculations is
contained in Table 2, and copies of the Level of Service calculations are attached.

Collision History

The collision histories for the study intersections were reviewed to determine any trends or patterns
that may indicate a safety issue. Collision rates were calculated based on collision data available from
the California Highway Patrol as published in their Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS)
reports between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2012. The calculated collision rates for the study
intersections were compared to average collision rates for similar facilities statewide, as indicated in
2010 Collision Data on California State Highways, Caltrans.

All of the study intersections experienced collision rates higher than the statewide averages for similar
facilities. However, no fatalities were reported during the five-year period studied, and the injury rate at
two out of the three intersections was lower than the statewide average for similar facilities. The
calculated collision rates are presented in Table 3 and details are attached.
Ms. Kirsten Chapman                                  Page 4                                 March 21, 2014

Note: c/mve = collisions per million vehicles entering the intersection; bold text indicates calculated
      collision rate higher than the statewide average

Since the calculated collision rates at all of the study intersections were higher than the statewide
averages for similar facilities, the collision data was further examined to determine any apparent trends
in collision types. At all of the study intersections, nearly 50 percent of the collisions were broadsides,
and most of the remaining collisions were rear-end or sideswipe. While rear-end and sideswipe
collisions are common collision types found at signalized intersections, on an arterial such as Hesperian
Boulevard, where conditions are occasionally congested, broadside collisions are sometimes attributed
to inadequate traffic signal timing or intersection design. It is therefore recommended that the County
staff review the traffic signal timings and intersection geometry at the three study intersections.

Further, it was noted that four reported collisions at the Hesperian Boulevard/Paseo Grande
intersection were pedestrian-related. According to the Hesperian Corridor Streetscape Improvement
Project Master Plan, improvements including enhanced crosswalks, wider sidewalks and pedestrian
countdown signal heads are planned along Hesperian Boulevard. It is anticipated that these
modifications will improve pedestrian crossing and safety at intersections on Hesperian Boulevard.

Alternative Modes of Transportation

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian signal phases, curb ramps, curb extensions,
and various streetscape amenities such as lighting, benches, etc. In general, a network of sidewalks,
crosswalks, pedestrian signals, and curb ramps exist along Hesperian Boulevard, Grant Avenue west of
Hesperian Boulevard, and Paseo Grande. However, no sidewalk currently exists on the south side of
Post Office Road connecting the project site to Hesperian Boulevard.

Bicycle Facilities

The Highway Design Manual, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), 2012, classifies
bikeways into three categories:

•    Class I Multi-Use Path: a completely separated right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles and
     pedestrians with cross flows of motorized traffic minimized.

•    Class II Bike Lane: a striped and signed lane for one-way bike travel on a street or highway.
Ms. Kirsten Chapman                               Page 5                                   March 21, 2014

•   Class III Bike Route: signing only for shared use with motor vehicles within the same travel lane on a
    street or highway.

Within the project vicinity, bike facilities do not exist on any of the study roadways. Bicyclists ride on
the sidewalks or share the roadway with motor vehicles. According to the Hesperian Corridor
Streetscape Improvement Project Master Plan, Class II bike lanes are planned along Hesperian Boulevard.

Transit Facilities

The Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit) provides fixed route bus service within San
Lorenzo as well as the majority of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. Within the project vicinity,
northbound bus stops are located on the east side of Hesperian Boulevard approximately 680 feet north
and 480 feet south of Post Office Road. The nearest southbound bus stop is located on the west side of
Hesperian Boulevard approximately 500 feet north of Post Office Road. Additionally, bus stops are
located on Paseo Grande on both sides of Hesperian Boulevard. These bus stops are located within
one-quarter mile of the project site, which is considered an acceptable walking distance to a transit stop.
Below is a summary of transit lines that currently serve the project site:

AC Transit Line S provides weekday a.m. and p.m. peak service between Hayward and San Francisco
(Transbay Temporary Terminal) along Hesperian Boulevard and Paseo Grande with approximately 30 to
60 minute headways.

AC Transit Line 85 provides service between San Leandro and Union City along Paseo Grande and
Hesperian Boulevard. On weekdays, service is provided between Foothill Square and Union Landing
Shopping Center with approximately one-hour headways. On weekends and holidays, service is
provided between the San Leandro BART station and South Hayward BART station with approximately
one-hour headways.

AC Transit Line 93 provides loop service to/from Hayward BART station to various destinations in San
Lorenzo, San Leandro, Ashland and Cherryland along Paseo Grande and Hesperian Boulevard with
approximately one-hour headways.

AC Transit Line 97 provides both weekday and weekend service along Hesperian Boulevard between
the Union City BART station and Bay Fair BART station with headways of approximately 10 to 30
minutes.

Two bicycles can be carried on most local AC Transit buses with bike rack space on a first come, first
served basis. Folding or collapsible bicycles are allowed to be carried inside the buses at all times.

Dial-a-ride, also known as paratransit, or door-to-door service, is provided by East Bay Paratransit and
is available for those who are unable to independently use the transit system due to a physical or mental
disability. East Bay Paratransit is designed to serve the needs of individuals with disabilities within the
majority of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.

Project Conditions

The project site located at 15888 Hesperian Boulevard is bound by Post Office Road to the north, a
residential neighborhood to the east, the San Lorenzo library to the south, and commercial uses to the
west. The project site currently has a vacant building on it that was previously used as a United States
Post Office. The project as proposed would demolish the exiting building on the site and construct 79

residential units for seniors. Vehicular access to the project site would be provided via two
driveways on Post Office Road. The most recent site plan, dated March 10, 2014, is attached.

Trip Generation

The anticipated trip generation for the proposed project was estimated using standard rates published
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, 2012 for a
“Senior Adult Housing-Attached” (ITE Land Use #252) use. The proposed project is expected to
generate an average of 272 new daily trips, including 15 trips during the a.m. peak hour and 18 trips
during the p.m. peak hour. The trip generation summary is provided in Table 4.

Trip Distribution

The trip distribution patterns used to allocate new project trips to the street network were determined
by reviewing existing turning movements at the study intersections, project site access points and
location of likely origins and destinations. The applied distribution assumptions are shown in Table 5.

Intersection Levels of Service

Upon the addition of project-related traffic to existing volumes, the study intersections are expected to
continue operating at an acceptable LOS C or better during both peak periods. These results are
summarized in Table 6 with Existing Conditions values shown for comparison purposes. Copies of the
Level of Service calculations are attached.

Alternative Modes of Transportation

Pedestrians

Given the proximity of adjacent land uses including commercial, public and civic, near the project site, it
is reasonable to assume that some project residents and staff employees will want to walk, bicycle,
and/or utilize transit to access the project site.

Sidewalks are provided on Hesperian Boulevard, Grant Avenue and Paseo Grande. However, a
sidewalk does not exist on the south side of Post Office Road along the project frontage, connecting the
project site to Hesperian Boulevard. As shown on the attached site plan, the project as proposed
includes constructing a sidewalk on the south side of Post Office Road along the project frontage. A
sidewalk is also proposed on the south side of Post Office Road between the commercial use driveway
and the western project driveway. Additionally, marked crosswalks including curb ramps are proposed
on Post Office Road in front of the project site near the utilities area and western project driveway.
These proposed improvements would provide adequate pedestrian connections between the project
site and Hesperian Boulevard as well as the commercial development located on the north side of Post
Office Road from across the site.

The existing pedestrian facilities, together with the proposed facilities, are expected to adequately serve
the project site. Additionally, roadway improvements including, wider sidewalks, benches, landscaping,
bus shelters, pedestrian lighting and enhanced crosswalks are planned along Hesperian Boulevard per
the Hesperian Corridor Streetscape Improvement Project Master Plan.

Bicycles

Currently, bike lanes do not exist on Hesperian Boulevard. However, class II bike lanes and bike racks
are planned along Hesperian Boulevard per the Hesperian Corridor Streetscape Improvement Project Master
Plan. The proposed project would not disrupt planned facilities or create an inconsistency with
applicable bicycle policies.

Transit

The transit bus stops located along Hesperian Boulevard and Paseo Grande are within a quarter-mile
distance, which is considered as acceptable walking distance to a transit stop. Existing and proposed
pedestrian facilities that would connect the project site to the bus stops would be adequate. The bus
stops are served by AC Transit, which connects to BART Stations, San Francisco, Hayward, Union City
Ms. Kirsten Chapman                                Page 8                                   March 21, 2014

and other nearby areas. The existing transit facilities, and existing and proposed pedestrian facilities, are
anticipated to adequately accommodate the project-generated transit trips.

Access and Parking

Based on the site plan, vehicular access to the project site would be provided via two full access
driveways on Post Office Road. The eastern driveway located near the project’s eastern property line
would be gated. The western project driveway would provide access to the parking stalls located on the
western side of the proposed building. Internally, pathways would connect the parking areas and the
residential units.

Sight Distance

At driveways, a substantially clear line of sight should be maintained between the driver of a vehicle
waiting at the crossroad and the driver of an approaching vehicle. Adequate time must be provided for
the waiting vehicle to either cross, turn left, or turn right, without requiring the through traffic to
radically alter their speed.

Sight distance along Post Office Road at the project driveways was evaluated based on sight distance
criteria contained in the Highway Design Manual published by Caltrans. The recommended sight distance
for minor street approaches that are either a private road or a driveway are based on stopping sight
distance and use the approach travel speeds as the basis for determining the recommended sight
distance.

The sight distance requirement at the project driveways was field measured. The speed limit on Post
Office Road is not posted. However, for sight distance evaluation purposes, a design speed of 25 miles
per hour was considered, resulting in a recommended minimum sight distance of 150 feet. Post Office
Road is relatively flat and straight on both sides of the project driveways. Sight distance from the
project driveways would be adequate both to the east and west.

Parking

The proposed project would provide 51 off-street parking spaces on site. The proposed parking spaces
would adequately accommodate all users including, residents, guests and staff. For the proposed
project, a “Parking Demand Assessment Report” was prepared separately and is attached for reference.

Conclusions

•   The proposed project would generate an average of 272 new daily trips, including 15 trips during
    the a.m. peak hour and 18 trips during the p.m. peak hour.

•   Currently, all of the study intersections operate acceptably during both peak hours and would
    continue to do so with the addition of project-generated traffic.

•   The calculated collision rates at all the study intersections were higher than the statewide averages
    for similar facilities.

•   Sight distance is adequate in both directions at the project driveways.

•   The proposed project would provide 51 off-street parking spaces on site.

•   The existing and proposed pedestrian facilities would be adequate to serve the project site.

•   The proposed project is not directly served by bicycle facilities. However, the proposed project
    would not disrupt any existing or planned facilities, or create an inconsistency with applicable bicycle
    policies.

•   The existing transit facilities near the project vicinity would adequately accommodate the project-
    generated transit trips.

Recommendations

•   It is recommended that County staff review the traffic signal timings and intersection geometry at
    the study intersections to see if modifications may be needed to address the history of broadside
    collisions at these three study intersections.
