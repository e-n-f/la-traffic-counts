2.0        INTRODUCTION 

2.1        Initial Study 

           Pursuant  to  Section  15063  of  the  State  California  Environmental  Quality  Act  (CEQA)  Guidelines 
           (Title 14,  California  Code  of  Regulations,  Sections  15000  et  seq.),  an  Initial  Study  is  a  preliminary 
           environmental  analysis  that  is  used  by  the  lead  agency  as  a  basis  for  determining  whether  an 
           EIR,  a  Mitigated  Negative  Declaration,  or  a  Negative  Declaration  is  required  for  a  project.  The 
           State  CEQA  Guidelines  require  that  an  Initial  Study  contain  a  project  description;  a  description  of 
           environmental  setting;  an  identification  of  environmental  effects  by  checklist  or  other  similar 
           form;  an  explanation  of  environmental  effects;  a  discussion  of  mitigation  for  significant 
           environmental  effects;  an  evaluation  of  the  project's  consistency  with  existing,  applicable  land 
           use controls; and the names of persons who prepared the study. 

           Public  Resources  Code  Section  21080(a)  states  that  analysis  of  a  project's  environmental  impacts 
           is  required  for  any  "discretionary  projects  proposed  to  be  carried  out  or  approved  by  public 
           agencies,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  enactment  and  amendment  of  zoning  ordinances."  In 
           this  case,  and  pursuant  to  Public  Resources  Code  Section  21080,  the  City  of  San  Bruno  has 
           determined  that  an  Initial  Study  is  required  to  determine  whether  there  is  substantial  evidence 
           that implementation of the Peninsular Plaza Project would result in environmental impacts. 

           State  CEQA  Guidelines  Section  15064  requires  that  when  an  Initial  Study  identifies  significant 
           environmental  impacts,  the  Lead  Agency  must  prepare  an  EIR.  However,  State  CEQA  Guidelines 
           Section  15070  provides  that  if  all  of  the  impacts  can  be  mitigated  to  a  less  than  significant  level, 
           the  Lead  Agency  may  instead  prepare  a  Mitigated  Negative  Declaration  (MND)  whereby 
           mitigation  measures  are  created  as  a  condition  of  project  approval.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
           evaluation,  it  has  been  determined  that  a  Mitigated  Negative  Declaration  is  appropriate  for  the 
           project because all identified impacts can be mitigated to a less than significant level. 

2.2        Public and Agency Review 

           This  Initial  Study  and  proposed  MND  will  be  circulated  for  public  and  agency  review  from  June 
           9, 2008 to July 9, 2008. Copies of this document are available for review at the following locations 
           and online at http://www.sanbruno.ca.gov

2.3        Project Approvals 

           As  a  public  agency  principally  responsible  for  approving  or  carrying  out  the  proposed  project, 
           the City of San Bruno (City) is the Lead Agency under CEQA and is responsible for certifying the 
           adequacy  of  the  environmental  document  and  approving  the  proposed  project.  It  is  anticipated 
           that the City Planning Commission and City Council will consider the proposed project in 2008.

3.0        PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

3.1        Introduction 

           The  City  of  San  Bruno  (City)  is  located  in  San  Mateo  County,  and  is  bordered  by  the  San 
           Francisco  International  Airport  (SFO)  to  the  east,  the  City  of  Millbrae  to  the  south,  the  City  of 
           Pacifica  and  unincorporated  San  Mateo  County  to  the  west,  and  the  City  of  South  San  Francisco 
           to  the  north  (See  Figure  1,  Location  Map:  400418  San  Mateo  Avenue).  The  City  has  many 
           transportation  routes  that  run  through  it,  including  Interstates  280  and  380,  Highway  101,  the 
           Bay  Area  Rapid  Transit  (BART)  and  a  BART Station, a commuter rail line (Caltrain) and Caltrain 
           station, and San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) bus services.  

           The  project  site  is  located  in  the  City's  Redevelopment  Plan  Area.  Development  patterns  in  the 
           broader  project  area  occurred  with  some  degree  of  irregularity  due  to  the  City's  early  founding 
           (1914)  and  proximity  to  SFO.  A  portion  of  the  City's  core  commercial  area  declined  over  time  in 
           terms  of  its  commercial  viability  and  vitality.  Through  a  series  of  planning  activities,  the  City 
           designated  the  commercial  core  and  some  surrounding  lands  as  redevelopment  areas  that  could 
           be  revitalized  to  improve  the  local  economy  and  provide  a  more  cohesive  City  identity.  The  City 
           adopted  its  Redevelopment  Plan  in  1999,  and  the  project  site  is  within  the  Plan  Area 
           (See Figure 2, City of San Bruno Redevelopment Plan Area). 

3.2        Project Summary 

           The project applicant is proposing to demolish the former El Camino Cinema and three adjoining 
           commercial  buildings  and  construct  in  their  place  a  mixeduse,  threestory  commercial  and 
           residential  building  with  an  integrated  multilevel  parking  structure  (see  Figure  3A3E, 
           Conceptual  Site  Plan).  The  former  San  Bruno  Cinema  building  is  currently  vacant  except  for  a 
           small  dental  office  that  would  be  vacated  prior  to  project  implementation.  The  proposed  project 
           would  contain  approximately  15,000  square  feet  (sf)  of  commercial  space  at  the  ground  level 
           fronting  San  Mateo  Avenue,  48  residential  units  above  the  commercial  space,  an  interior 
           courtyard  for  the  benefit  of  the  project's  residents,  and  a  152space  parking  structure  facility 
           integrated within the building. 

           The current land uses on the project site are vacant commercial space and one dental office. In the 
           past, the site has been used for a variety of commercial and office uses. The exterior of the cinema 
           building  has  been  altered  over  time  to  accommodate  a  variety  of  tenants.  The  other  two 
           commercial  buildings  adjacent  to  the  cinema  are  onestory  midcentury  construction  with 
           frontages  along  San  Mateo  Avenue.  This  has  resulted  in  adjacent  commercial  buildings  that  lack 
           aesthetic  and  visual  unity.  The  exterior  features  associated  with  the  cinema  building  dating  from 
           its  initial  construction  and  use  as  a  cinema  have  been  lost  due  to  the  multiple  exterior 
           modifications.  The  proposed  project  would  replace  the  existing  building  with  a  threestory 
           mixeduse commercial and residential development that would visually enhance the existing site 
           and provide an improved visual anchor and entry to the City's downtown commercial area.

3.3        Project Location and Surrounding Uses 

           The  project  site  is  bounded  by  San  Mateo  Avenue,  Taylor  Avenue,  and  Mastick  Avenue  in  the 
           southern  portion  of  the  City's  downtown  area.  The  project  site  is  surrounded  by  residential  uses 
           to  the  east,  and  commercial  uses  to  the  north,  west,  and  south.  The  project  site  is  completely 
           developed  with  existing  structures  and  a  parking  lot.  There  are  several  ornamental  trees  on  the 
           site,  including  pine  and  eucalyptus.  The  site  is  characterized  by  a  slight  westtoeast  slope,  with 
           the  eastern  portion  of  the  site  approximately  10  feet  lower  than  the  western  portion.  The  project 
           site is approximately 1 acre in size (See Figure 3A).  

3.4        Project Site Zoning 

           The  project  site  is  zoned  Central  Business  District  (CBD)  and  LowDensity  Residential  (R2). 
           Based  on  the  County  Assessor's  parcel  record,  the  net  parcel  area  is  42,348  square  feet.  Utilizing 
           the  density  of  one  unit  per  1,000  feet,  as  outlined  in  the  CBD  description,  there  could  be  a 
           maximum  of  42  multifamily  units  on  the  upper  levels  and  a  variety  of  commercial  uses  on  the 
           ground level.  

3.5        Affordable Housing 

           The  City  relies  on  the  California  State  density  bonus  law,  established  by  SB  1818,  to  encourage 
           the  development  of  affordable  units.  The  applicant  would  provide  20  percent  of  the  residential 
           units  (8  units)  at  a  price  affordable  to  moderateincome  citizens  (as  determined  annually  by  the 
           Department  of  Housing  and  Community  Development).  As  a  result  of  this  affordable  housing 
           component,  the  applicant  has  requested  a  density  bonus  of  6  units,  for  a  total  of  48  units.  The 
           density  bonus  is  a  discretionary  action,  and  is  therefore  part  of  the  approval  process  for  the 
           project,  consistent  with  the  conditions  of  the  density  bonus  program.  Both  the  market  rate  and 
           moderateincome  units  would  count  toward  partial  fulfillment  of  the  City's  Regional  Housing 
           Allocation, as outlined in the City's Housing Element.  

3.6        Project Characteristics 

           A detailed description of the project characteristics is provided below. 

3.6.1      Project Design and Landscaping Features 

           Building Design 

           The  project  design  reflects  Europeaninspired  pedestrian  friendly  streetscape  architectural  style, 
           which was guided by the City's Redevelopment Plan. The project's design is intended to produce 
           a building design that improves the aesthetics of the built corridor along San Mateo Avenue. The 
           proposed  project  design  includes  a  rounded  50foottall  columnar  structure  at  the  intersection  of 
           San Mateo Avenue and Taylor Avenue.  

           The  approximately  15,000  sf  of  groundlevel  commercial  space  would  front  on  San  Mateo 
           Avenue,  with  the  152space  offstreet  parking  area  for  the  project  located  in  a  twolevel  structure 
           located behind the commercial portion of the project (See discussion of offstreet parking below).

0944001                                                                                                                 June 2008 
                                                                                                 3.0  Project Description 


           The  48  residential  units  would  include  a  mix  of  studios, 1, 2 and 3bedroom condominium flats 
           (singlelevel)  and  multilevel  loft  units.  The  units  would  be  located  above  the  commercial  space 
           and  parking  structure.  The  project  design  includes  a  central  private  courtyard  that  would  be 
           reserved  for  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  the  project's  residents.  Each  of  the  residential  units  would 
           have  a  balcony  facing  either  outward  to  the  exterior  of  the  project  or  inward  toward  the  central 
           courtyard.  The  project  would  also  include  a  community  room  for  use  by  the  project's  residents. 
           The  main  pedestrian  entrance  to  the  residential  portion  of  the  project  would  be  on  San  Mateo 
           Avenue. 

           Air  handling  units  would  be  located  on  the  flat  portion  of  the  building's  roof  surrounded  by  a 
           parapet wall to visually shield the equipment from view as well as to provide noise attenuation. 

           The  project  design  takes  advantage  of  the  project  site's  westtoeast  downward  slope  by  placing 
           the parking levels at the eastern, or lower portion of the site. This allows the covered parking that 
           is  atgrade  with  Mastick  Avenue  to  extend  approximately  500  feet  to  the  middle  of  the  project 
           site,  placing  it  adjacent  to  the  proposed  retail  space.  The  additional  underground  parking  level 
           would  be  easily  integrated  into  the  project  site  and  would  extend  underneath  the  entire  project 
           footprint.  

           Colors and Materials 

           The  exterior  of  the  building  would  utilize  various  materials  to  break  up  the  visual  bulk  of  the 
           building.  Brick  veneer  and  cement  plaster  would  be  the  main  exterior  wall  materials,  and  would 
           be  a  combination  of  three  complimentary  muted  colors.  A  dark  red  brick  would  be  the  primary 
           color and would be accented by creamcolored cement plaster and dark grey painted metal. Door 
           and window frames would be painted metal. Exterior balconies off of the residential units would 
           be constructed of painted metal with a decorative soffit, or cover, of a contrasting color. Exposed, 
           unfinished concrete would be used and visible near the parking structure entrance. 

           Lighting 

           Internal  lighting  would  utilize  indirect  sunlight  where  appropriate  and  operable  shades  on 
           exterior  windows  to  reduce  bright  light  and  glare  at  various  times  of  day.  Exterior  lighting 
           features  would  be  implemented  at  both  the  retail  and  residential  entrances,  in  the  proposed 
           parking  lot  structure,  and  along  the  sidewalks  of  the  project  site.  Primary  exterior  lighting 
           fixtures  would  be  wallmounted  with  frosted  glass  covers.  Additional  security  exterior  lighting 
           would be provided near all doorways and would utilize brighter light bulbs for safety. 

           Landscaping 

           Approximately  19  trees  would  be  planted  along  the  perimeter  sidewalk  of  the  proposed  project. 
           For  a  detailed  description  of  all  plants  and  the  approximate  location  of  landscaping  included  in 
           the  project,  please  see  Figure  4,  Landscaping  Plan.  The  trees  would  be  planted  into  the  ground 
           with  a  grate  covering  their exposed soil to protect the root systems. There are three types of trees 
           proposed  along  the  exterior,  myrtle  trees,  New  Zealand  Christmas  trees,  and  pear  trees.  There 
           would  be  a  series  of  raised  planters  along  the  Taylor  Avenue  exterior  and  the  Mastic  Avenue 
           exterior.  Typical  plants  in  these  planters  would  be  vines,  rosemary,  bamboo,  flax,  lavender,  and 
           Japanese boxwood.

0944001                                                                                                                 June 2008 
                                                                                                 3.0  Project Description 


           Landscaping  would  also  be  provided  in  a  private  open  space  area  for  residents  on  the  second 
           level  of  the  project.  This  open  space  area  would  consist  of  14  small  trees  and  several  planters 
           with perennial flowers. 

3.6.2      Vehicular Access, Parking, and Pedestrian Access 

           Vehicular  access  to  the  site  would  be  via  an  entrance  on  Mastick  Avenue.  The  proposed  project 
           would provide two levels of parking, one atgrade level with Mastic Avenue for the benefit of the 
           onsite commercial uses and one restricted access subterranean level for the project residents. The 
           atgrade  parking  level  would  provide  48  parking  spaces  whereas  the  underground  level  would 
           provide 104 spaces. 

           The  applicant  has  proposed  the  provision  of  152  parking  spaces,  including  5  spaces  designed  to 
           be consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. As part of the proposed 
           project,  the  applicant  is  seeking  approval  of  shared  parking  between  the  commercial  and 
           residential  uses.  The  City  parking  requirements  for  the  project  site  indicate  that  60  parking 
           spaces  are  required  to  support  the  commercial  uses.  For  the  residential  uses,  the  City  would 
           require  101  parking  spaces.  Therefore,  the  total  required  parking spaces would be 161. However, 
           the  applicant  is  proposing  152  spaces,  which  does  not  meet  the  City's  parking  requirement.  The 
           applicant  is  seeking  approval  of  a  reduction  from  the  City's  parking  standard  due  to  the  higher 
           density housing and provision of affordable housing. These components of the project allow it to 
           fall  under  the  purview  of  the  State  density  bonus  law  which  allows  for  a  reduction  from  the 
           City's Parking Ordinance.  

           There  would  be  at  least  three  pedestrian  entrances  to  the  building  along  the  retail  storefronts  of 
           San  Mateo  Avenue  and  an  exclusive  residential  entrance  also  along  San  Mateo  Avenue.  The  at
           grade  parking  level  would  provide  a  pedestrian  exit  to  San  Mateo  Avenue  as  this  parking  level 
           would be designated for commercial parking. The underground parking level would have access 
           to  the  residential  area  on  the  second  and  third  stories  through  a  stairwell  and  elevator  located 
           near  the  Taylor  Avenue  project  boundary  because  the  underground  level  would  be  restricted  to 
           residents  only.  Additionally,  the  underground  parking  level  would  have  a  restricted  access 
           stairwell exiting to San Mateo Avenue.  

3.6.3      Infrastructure 

           Infrastructure  improvements  would  be  necessary  to  provide  water,  sanitary  sewer,  and  storm 
           drainage  services  to  the  site.  Domestic  water  is  currently  available  to  the  site  via  an  existing 
           8inch  highpressure  water  main  located  within  San  Mateo  Avenue,  with  a  1inch  lateral 
           extension to the site. The existing water main would be upgraded to allow for additional capacity 
           and  extended  50  feet  east  to  provide  sufficient  potable  and  fire  suppression  service  to  the  new 
           land uses, consistent with City requirements.  

           A  new  sanitary  sewer  connection  would  be  required  to  connect  to  the  existing  6inch  sanitary 
           sewer  main  located  within  San  Mateo  Avenue.  An  onsite  stormwater  system  would  be 
           constructed  to  collect  stormwater  and  discharge  it  to  the  existing  storm  drainage  system  within 
           San Mateo Avenue.

3.7        Project Population 

           The  estimated  resident  population  of  the  project  would  be  132  people  for  the  48  units,  based  on 
           the California Department of Finance's E5 Population and Housing Estimates 1 (January 1, 2007).  

3.8        Construction Schedule 

           Project  construction  is  anticipated  to  begin  in  spring  2009,  and  continue  for  approximately  20 
           months. The project is anticipated to be completed and ready for occupancy at the end of 2010. 

3.9        Approvals Requested 

           Architectural  Review  Permit  The  proposed  project  design  would  require  an  architectural 
           review permit. 

           Zone Change ­ The proposed project would change the onsite zoning from R2 to CBD. 

           Tentative  Map  ­  Pursuant  to  the  Subdivison  Map  Act,  approval  of  the  tentative  map  would  be 
           required. 

           Density Increase ­ Pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law, the proposed density increases and 
           associated  incentives  would  require  approval  to  allow  increased  density  and  reduced  parking 
           spaces.

6.0        EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 

           This  section  includes  an  evaluation  of  impacts  based  on  the  State  CEQA  Guidelines  Appendix  G 
           Environmental  Checklist,  adapted  to  reflect  the  significance  thresholds  adopted  by  the  City  of 
           San  Bruno.  Each  checklist  item  is  explained  in  the  discussion  following  the  checklist  and,  if 
           necessary,  mitigation  measures  are  provided  to  reduce  impacts  to  a  less  than  significant  level.  In 
           accordance  with  CEQA,  all  answers  take  into  account  the  whole  of  the  action,  including  on  and 
           offsite effects, direct and indirect effects, and effects from both construction and operation of any 
           new development. 

           Each checklist criterion is marked to identify whether there is an environmental impact.  

           ·     A "No Impact" response indicates that there is no impact.  
           ·     A  "Less  Than  Significant  Impact"  response  means  that  while  there  is  some  impact,  the 
                 impact is below the threshold of significance defined by the City.  
           ·     A  "Less  Than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation"  response  indicates  that  a  new  impact  has 
                 been  identified  in  the  course  of  this  analysis  and  new  mitigation  measures  have  been 
                 provided  in  this  Initial  Study  to  reduce  the  potentially  significant  impact  to  a  less  than 
                 significant level. 
           ·     A  "Potentially  Significant  Impact"  response  indicates  that  a  new  impact  has  been  identified 
                 in  the  course  of  this  analysis  and  further  analysis  is  required  to  determine  if  mitigation 
                 measures  could  be  imposed  on  the  project  to  reduce  the  impact  to  a  less  than  significant 
                 level.  
           If  a  significant  impact  is  identified  that  could  not  be  reduced  to  a  less  than  significant  level,  the 
           box  "Potential  Significant  Impact"  would  be  checked.  According  to  CEQA,  if  such  an  impact 
           were  identified,  an  Initial  Study  would  not  be  sufficient  to  approve  the  proposed  project,  and  an 
           Environmental Impact Report (EIR) would be necessary. No such impacts have been identified in 
           the course of preparing this Initial Study.

        views in the area? 

 
DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  City  of  San  Bruno  (City)  General  Plan  identifies  existing  and 
           potential  scenic  corridors  as  well  as  street  beautification  projects  in  the  City  as  scenic  resources. 
           No  other  scenic  resources  or  vistas  are  identified  within  the  City.  The  nearest  designated  scenic 
           corridor  to  the  project  site  is  Crystal  Springs  Road.  The  portion  of  this  road  that  is  designated  as 
           mile  from  the  project  site,  to  the  San  Bruno  City  Park,  which  is  approximately  1,500  feet  west  of 
           the  project  site.  Given  the  existing  elevation  of  Crystal  Springs  Road  near  the  project  site  and  the 
           density  of  homes  to  the  west  of  the  site,  longrange  views  from  the  designated  scenic  corridor  of 
           the  site  are  not  readily  available.  Given  that  existing  views  for  the  public  from  a  designated 
           scenic  corridor  do  not  afford  views  of  the  project  site,  implementation  of  the  proposed  project 
           would not have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista. Therefore, this impact is considered 
           less than significant. 

b.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  California  Department  of  Transportation  administers 
           California's  Scenic  Highways  Program.  Designated  California  Scenic  Highways  in  the  vicinity  of 
           the  project  site  include  State  Route  35  (SR  35  or  Skyline  Boulevard)  and  Interstate  280  (I280) 
           (Caltrans  2007).  SR  35  is  a  designated  Scenic  Highway  from  the  Santa  Cruz  County  line  to  State 
           Route 92, south of the project site. The project site is roughly 1.5 miles east of SR 35; however, the 
           project  site  is  not  visible  from  this  roadway  due  to  intervening  land  uses  and  differences  in 
           elevation.  I280  is  a  designated  Scenic  Highway  from  the  Santa  Clara  County  line  to  the  San 
           Bruno  city  limit,  and  is  roughly  1  mile  east  of  the  project  site.  Given  the  distance  and  existing 
           topography  from  this  freeway  to  the  project  site,  views  for  motorists  would  not  be  obscured  by 
           the proposed project. The project site does not contain, nor is it in the immediate vicinity of scenic 
           resources  such  as  rock  outcroppings  or  any  designated  historic  buildings.  Please  see  Section  6.5,

                                                                           6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           Cultural Resources, for the historical evaluation of the existing building on the project site. While 
           the  project  would  remove  some  trees  along  the  sidewalks  and  existing  parking  lot,  it  would  not 
           substantially alter the visual environment from the removal of such trees. Therefore, the project's 
           impact would be less than significant. 

c.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  site  is  located  in  a  builtup  urban  area,  in  the  vicinity 
           of existing detached singlefamily homes and commercial land uses. The proposed project would 
           replace  an  existing  threestory  cinema  structure,  as  well  as  two  smaller  commercial  buildings 
           along  San  Mateo  Avenue.  The  existing  cinema  commercial  building  on  the  project  site  is 
           approximately 48 feet at its highest point, which includes an elevated eastern portion as well as a 
           façade  on  the  San  Mateo  Avenue  frontage.  The  existing  visual  character  of  these  buildings  lacks 
           continuity  given  the  various  uses  that  have  occupied  the  buildings  and  the  lack  of  architectural 
           unity.  The  proposed  project  would  construct  an  approximately  50foottall  building  that 
           minimally  increase  the  height  of  the  existing  structure  at  the  cinema  site,  given  the  existing 
           structure's  48foot  height.  The  proposed  project  would  be  subject  to  the  City's  Architectural 
           Design  Review.  There  would  be  a  more  substantial  increase  in  height  where  the  two  former  bars 
           are  located.  Currently,  these  buildings  are  approximately  16  feet  tall.  However,  the  proposed 
           project  would  implement  a  new  threestory  building  that  would  have  a  contemporary  design  to 
           create  visual  interest  and  as  well  as  a  cohesive  structure.  The  proposed  project  would  also 
           improve  the  visual  gateway  to  the  City's  downtown  redevelopment  area  for  pedestrians  and 
           motorists traveling north along San Mateo Avenue. 

           The  project  would  result  in  improvements  to  the  site,  including  removal  of  outdated  and  vacant 
           commercial  structures.  The  project  would  also  add  landscaping  along  the  project  sidewalks. 
           Therefore, while changes to visual character on the site would occur, these changes would not be 
           substantially adverse. Therefore, the project's impact would be less than significant. 

d.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  site  is  located  in  a  builtup  commercial  and  residential 
           area,  with  existing  commercial  uses  to  the  north,  west,  and  south,  and  singlefamily  homes 
           located  to  the  east.  Nearby  streets  provide  sources  of  lighting.  Existing  uses  on  the  project  site 
           generate  some  exterior  lighting  on  the  building  as  well  as  the  parking  area.  New  mixeduse 
           development  proposed  as  part  of  the  project  would  generate  light  and  glare  associated  with 
           exterior  lighting  for  design  and  security  purposes.  However,  exterior  lighting  throughout  the 
           project  site  would  utilize  fixtures  designed  to  minimize  light  spillage  and  would  direct  light 
           downwards  to  not  further  intrude  into  the  nighttime  sky.  Because  the  project  is  within  an  urban 
           setting,  the  increases  in  light  attributed  to  the  project  would  not  be  considered  substantial  and 
           would not adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area; and therefore the impact would be 
           less  than  significant.  The  following  mitigation  measures  would  be  implemented  to  ensure  that 
           the  increase  in  lighting  associated  with  the  proposed  project  does  not  cause  adverse  effects 
           related to increased light and glare. 

           Mitigation  Measure  VIS1:  To  minimize  light  and  glare,  low  profile  and  lowintensity  lighting 
           directed downward shall be used for the exterior facades and all security lighting; 

           Mitigation  Measure  VIS2:  Shielded  fixtures  shall  be  used  on  all  exterior  fixtures  to  minimize 
           glare produced by lighting onsite.

    AGRICULTURAL  RESOURCES    In  determining 
    whether impacts to agricultural resources are significant 
    environmental  effects,  lead  agencies  may  refer  to  the 
    California  Agricultural  Land  Evaluation  and  Site 
    Assessment  Model  (1997)  prepared  by  the  California 
    Dept.  of  Conservation  as  an  optional  model  to  use  in 
    assessing  impacts  on  agriculture  and  farmland.  Would 
    the project: 

    a)  Convert  Prime  Farmland,  Unique  Farmland,  or 
        Farmland  of  Statewide  Importance  (Farmland),  as 
        shown  on  the  maps  prepared  pursuant  to  the 
        Farmland  Mapping  and  Monitoring  Program  of  the 
                                                                                                                               
        California  Resources  Agency,  to  nonagricultural 
        use? 

    b)  Conflict  with  existing  zoning  for  agricultural  use,  or 
        a Williamson Act contract? 
                                                                                                                               

    c)  Involve  other  changes  in  the  existing  environment, 
        which,  due  to  their  location  or  nature,  could  result                                                           
        in conversion of Farmland, to nonagricultural use? 
 
DISCUSSION: 

a.­c.      No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  located  in  a  developed  area.  The  site  is  designated  as 
           Neighborhood/Commercial  by  the  General  Plan,  and  is  zoned  CBD  and  R2,  Low  Density 
           Residential.  According  to  the  General  Plan  and  San  Mateo  County  Assessor,  there  are  no 
           Williamson  Act  contracts  within  the  vicinity  of  the  project.  The  project  would  not  result  in  the 
           conversion of farmland to a nonagricultural use onsite and offsite because there is no farmland 
           within  the  project  site  or  in  the  vicinity.  Therefore,  implementation  of  the  project  would  not 
           impact agricultural resources.

    AIR  QUALITY    Where  available,  the  significance 
    criteria  established  by  the  applicable  air  quality 
    management  or  air  pollution  control  district  may  be 
    relied  upon  to  make  the  following  determinations. 
    Would the project: 

    a)  Conflict  with  or  obstruct  implementation  of  the 
                                                                                                                                
        applicable air quality plan? 

    b)  Violate  any  air  quality  standard  or  contribute 
        substantially  to  an  existing  or  projected  air  quality                                                            
        violation?

        ambient  air  quality  standard  (including  releasing 
        emissions,  which  exceed  quantitative  thresholds  for 
        ozone precursors)? 

    d)  Expose  sensitive  receptors  to  substantial  pollutant 
        concentrations?

        number of people? 

 
DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  Bay  Area  Air  Quality  Management  District  (BAAQMD) 
           prepares  air  quality  plans  based  on  population  projections  from  Association  of  Bay  Area 
           Governments  (ABAG)  and  development  projections  from  various  general  plans.  Therefore,  if  a 
           project  is  consistent  with  its  applicable  general  plan,  in  this  case  the  San  Bruno  General  Plan,  it 
           would  have  been  accounted  for  in  the  air  quality  plan  and  would  not  conflict  or  obstruct 
           implementation of the plan. 

           The  proposed  project  would  require  the  demolition  of  four  existing  commercial  buildings  and 
           parking  lot.  Following  demolition,  a  mixeduse  threestory  building  would  be  constructed.  The 
           proposed  project  would  include  15,000  square  feet  of  commercial  space,  48  residential  units,  and 
           152  parking  spaces.  The  project  site  is  currently  zoned  for  CBD  and  R2.  Therefore,  the 
           commercial  portion  of  the  proposed  project  would  be  consistent  with  the  General  Plan.  The

0944001                                                                                                                   June 2008 
                                                                             6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           residential zoning would only allow for 42 units; however, the proposed project would provide 8 
           affordable  (moderateincome)  units  that  would  allow  an  additional  6  units  according  to  the 
           City's  density  bonus  program.  The  City's  density  bonus  program,  pursuant  to  the  California 
           density  bonus  law,  encourages  the  development  of  affordable  units.  The  proposed  commercial 
           and  residential  uses  would  be  consistent  with  the  San  Bruno  General  Plan  and  therefore  would 
           not  conflict  or  obstruct  with  implementation  of  the  applicable  air  quality  plan.  Therefore  the 
           project`s impact would be less than significant. 

b.         Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  Development  of  the  proposed  project  would 
           involve  the  demolition  of  the  existing  San  Bruno  Cinema  building  along  with  two  commercial 
           buildings.  Construction  of  the  proposed  project  would  also  require  grading  of  the  project  site 
           following  demolition.  During  construction  of  the  proposed  project,  PM10  fugitive  dust  emissions 
           would  occur  due  to  earthmoving  and  grading  activities.  These  activities  have  the  potential  to 
           cause a shortterm significant impact with respect to air quality standards.  

           The  BAAQMD  emphasizes  the  importance  of  implementing  all  feasible  control  measures  during 
           construction  rather  than  quantification  of  construction  emissions.  Accordingly,  the  BAAQMD 
           CEQA  Guidelines  recommend  that  all  projects  implement  the  "basic"  fugitive  dust  control 
           measures from Table 2 of the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines. For projects that would be greater than 
           4  acres  in  size  or  be  located  close  to  sensitive  receptors,  "enhanced"  and  "optional"  control 
           measures  are  also  recommended.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  emissions  of  carbon  monoxide 
           (CO)  and  ozone  precursors  are  considered  to  be  already  included  in  the  regional  air  quality  plan 
           and  are  not  expected  to  impede  attainment  or  maintenance  of  those  standards.  With 
           implementation  of  Mitigation  Measure  AIR1  (control  measures  recommended  by  the 
           BAAQMD),  the  proposed  project  would  not  violate  any  air  quality  standards.  Therefore,  the 
           proposed project's impact would be considered less than significant.  

           In  addition,  the  buildings  to  be  demolished  are  suspected  to  contain  asbestos  and  leadbased 
           paint.  The  BAAQMD,  in  addition  to  achieving  the  PM10  ambient  air  quality  standards,  is  also 
           concerned  with  asbestos  emissions  during  demolition  activities.  In  compliance  with  the 
           BAAQMD  regulations  for  asbestoscontaining  material  and  Mitigation  Measure  HAZ2  (in 
           Section 6.7), any building suspected of containing asbestos materials (ACMs) requires BAAQMD 
           review  and  authorization  prior  to  the  Building  Division  issuance  of  a  building  or  demolition 
           permit.  The  Building  Division  reviews  the  application  for  a  permit  and  requires  the  applicant  to 
           retain  the  services  of  a  licensed  and  certified  asbestos  inspector  to  perform  a  site  inspection  and, 
           if  necessary,  removal  of  all  ACMs.  The  applicant  is  referred  to  the  BAAQMD  for  removal 
           compliance  pursuant  to  the  BAAQMD  regulations.  The  City  does  not  issue  any  building  or 
           demolition  permits  until  the  applicant  returns  with  written  verification  from  BAAQMD  that 
           compliance  has  been  met.  With  full  implementation  of  this  requirement,  along  with  Mitigation 
           Measures  HAZ1  and  HAZ2,  the  proposed  project  would  reduce  potential  impacts  from 
           asbestos and leadbased paint to a less than significant level. 

           Mitigation  Measure  AIR1:  The  project  applicant  shall  ensure  that  the  following  measures  are 
           implemented during construction of the proposed project: 

           ·     Water all active construction surfaces at least twice daily; 
           ·     Cover  all  truck  hauling  soil,  sand,  and  other  loose  materials  or  require  all  trucks  to  maintain 
                 at least two feet of freeboard;

           ·     Pave,  apply  water  three  times  daily,  or  apply  (nontoxic)  soil  stabilizers  on  all  unpaved 
                 access roads, parking areas and staging areas at construction sites; 
           ·     Sweep daily (with water sweepers) all paved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at 
                 construction sites; and 
           ·     Sweep  streets  daily  (with  water  sweepers)  if  visible  soil  material  is  carried  onto  adjacent 
                 public streets. 
c.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Following  construction  of  the  proposed  project,  operational 
           emissions  would  be  generated  as  a  result  of  vehicle  trips  to  and  from  the  proposed  project.  Air 
           emissions  generated  from  these  trips  would  cumulatively  contribute  to  air  emissions  in  the 
           region.  However,  the  BAAQMD  CEQA  Guidelines  indicate  that  residential  developments 
           containing  fewer  than  320  singlefamily  units  or  510  apartments  are  not  likely  to  result  in  a 
           cumulatively  considerable  air  quality  impact.  In  addition,  the  Guidelines  identify  general  office 
           buildings  less  than  280,000  square  feet  as  not  being  likely  to  result  in  a  cumulative  considerable 
           air  quality  impact.  The  proposed  project  would  develop  land  uses  much  less  than  the  levels 
           identified  in  the  BAAQMD  CEQA  Guidelines;  therefore,  although  the  proposed  project  would 
           generate  air  emissions  in  the  region,  the  emissions  would  not  make  a  cumulatively  considerable 
           contribution to a cumulative impact on air quality.  

           In  addition,  the  BAAQMD  CEQA  Guidelines  recommend  thresholds  of  significance  for 
           operational  emissions  of  ROG  and  NOX.  Projects  that  would  generate  emissions  below  the 
           significance  thresholds  are  considered  not  to  cause  a  significant  impact  and  would  not  cause  a 
           cumulatively  considerable  impact  to  air  quality.  The  operational  emissions  associated  with  the 
           proposed  project  were  calculated  using  the  land  use  and  emissions  estimation  model, 
           URBEMIS2007  Version  9.2.2.  Trip  generation  values  were  obtained  from  the  traffic  study 
           prepared  by  DKS  Associates.  An  operational  year  of  2010  was  used  to  estimate  the  proposed 
           project's  operational  emissions.  Table  1,  Peninsular  Plaza  Estimated  Operational  Emissions  -- 
           Unmitigated,  presents  the  project's  operational  emissions  assuming  a  2010  buildout  year.  As 
           shown  below  in  Table  1,  the  project's  longterm  operational  emissions  of  ROG  and  NOX  would 
           not  exceed  the  BAAQMD  thresholds  of  significance.  Therefore,  the  proposed  project  would  not 
           make  a  cumulatively  considerable  contribution  to  a  cumulative  impact  on  air  quality  in  the 
           region.

d.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  proposed  project  would  develop  residential  units  and 
           commercial  space.  The  proposed  project  would  not  operate  any  point  sources  that  would 
           generate substantial concentrations of pollutants. Emissions associated with the proposed project 
           would  primarily  be  from  vehicles.  Three  exhaust  fans  would  be  provided  in  the  underground 
           portion  of  the  parking  garage  to  maintain  circulation  and  avoid  a  buildup  of  vehicle  exhaust 
           emissions.  Vehicle  congestion  and  delay  at  intersections  could  lead  to  a  CO  hotspot  (violation  of 
           the  California  or  federal  ambient  air  quality  standard).  However,  the  maximum  background 
           concentration  registered  in  San  Mateo  County  (i.e.,  Redwood  City)  in  the  past  three  years  was 
           approximately  31  percent  of  the  state  8hour  standard.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  proposed 
           project's  traffic  would  cause  an  exceedance  of  the  standard  and  therefore,  the  project's  impact 
           would  be  considered  less  than  significant.  In  addition,  the  intersections  impacted  by  the 
           proposed  project's  traffic  would  all  operate  at  a  level  of  service  (LOS) 2  D  or  above.  Intersections 
           determined to operate at LOS E or F have the potential to cause a CO hotspot. Implementation of 
           the  proposed  project  would  not  degrade  the  LOS  of  any  impacted  intersection  below  D. 
           Therefore,  even  with  the  addition  of  the  proposed  project's  traffic,  intersections  would  not  be 
           affected  to  a  degree  where  CO  hotspots  could  occur.  Furthermore,  during  future  conditions,  all 
           affected  intersections  would  still  operate  at  LOS  D  and  above;  therefore,  the  project's  impact 
           would be considered less than significant.  

                                                           
2  Levels of Service (LOS) range from A (least congested) with a condition of free flow with low 
      volumes and high speeds to F (most congested) with stop and go, lowspeed conditions with little or 
      poor maneuverability.

e.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  proposed  project  would  include  residential  units  and 
           commercial  space.  These  are  not  typical  land  uses  associated  with  creating  objectionable  odors. 
           Any garbage or waste generated by the residential units or commercial uses will be collected and 
           disposed of according to the City requirements. In addition, odors could potentially be generated 
           during  shortterm  architectural  coating  activities.  However,  any  architectural  coatings  used  for 
           the  proposed  project  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  BAAQMD  Regulation  8  Rule  3 
           Architectural  Coatings.  This  rule  limits  the  quantity  of  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs) 
           contained  in  architectural  coatings  sold,  used,  or  manufactured  within  the  District.  Compliance 
           with  Regulation  8  Rule  3  would  minimize  any  odor  impacts  from  architectural  coating 
           operations. Therefore, the project's impact would be considered less than significant.

DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  No  natural  habitats  or  vegetation  communities 
           currently exist on the site, and due to the area's long history of disturbance, it is unlikely that the 
           proposed  project  would  have  direct  or  indirect  adverse  effects  on  any  rare,  endangered,  or 
           threatened  species.  The  California  Natural  Diversity  Data  Base  (CNDDB)  does  document 
           occurrences  of  special  status  species  within  the  USGS  quadrangles  containing  or  adjacent  to  the 
           site,  but  many  of  these  are  historical  or  associated  with  sensitive  habitats  not  found  on  the  site 
           (California  Department  of  Fish  and  Game  [CDFG,  2007]).  Habitat  for  any  of  the  special  status 
           species  plant  or  animal  species  or  native  communities  listed  by  the  CNDDB  or  California  Native 
           Plant  Society  (2007)  no  longer  exists  at  the  project  site.  There  are  no  wetlands  on  the  property,  as 
           defined by either the federal Clean Water Act or the State or the State of California. A site survey 
           was  conducted  by  Impact  Sciences,  Inc.  on  August  28,  2007,  to  verify  existing  conditions,  assess 
           vegetation  and  wildlife  habitats,  and  identify  the  potential  for  sensitive  species  to  occur  onsite. 
           The  project  site  is  completely  developed  with  existing  structures  and  a  parking  lot.  Tree  species 
           occurring  on  the  project  site  include  pine  and  eucalyptus,  and  various  other  trees  planted  as 
           landscaping.  Given  the  urban  location  of  the  project  site,  the  scattered  location  of  the  existing 
           trees, and the fact that the site is not adjacent to an area providing foraging habitat, use of the on
           site trees as nesting habitat by specialstatus bird species is not expected. 


           However,  the  trees  on  the  project  site  provide  suitable  nesting  habitat  for  a  variety  of  common 
           bird  species  known  to  occur  in  the  project  area.  Constructionrelated  activities could result in the 
           direct  loss  of  active  nests  or  the  abandonment  of  active  nests  by  adult  birds  during  that  year's 
           nesting  season.  Bird  nests  with  eggs  or  young  are  protected  under  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act 
           and  the  California  Fish  and  Game  Code.  Mitigation  Measures  BIO1  through  BIO3,  applied  to 
           the  project  during  construction  activities  (that  could  disturb  nesting  birds),  would  reduce  the 
           potential impact to a less than significant level. 

           Mitigation  Measure  BIO1:  The  applicant  shall  retain  a  qualified  biologist  (with  selection  to  be 
           approved  by  the  City)  to  conduct  a  survey  on  the  site  prior  to  construction  or  site  preparation 
           activities  occurring  during  the  nesting/breeding  season  of  native  bird  species  (typically  February 
           through  August).  The  survey  area  shall  include  all  potential  nesting  habitat  on  the  project  site 
           and  within  200  feet  of  the  grading  boundaries.  If  the  200foot  distance  encompasses  trees  on 
           adjacent properties, the biologist shall survey the trees using binoculars. 

           The  survey  shall  be  conducted  no  more  than  14  days  prior  to  commencement  of  construction 
           activities. 

           Mitigation  Measure  BIO2:  If  active  nests  of  bird  species  protected  by  the Migratory Bird Treaty 
           Act and/or the California Fish and Game Code (which, together, apply to all native nesting birds) 
           are  present  in  the  construction  zone  or  within  200  feet  of  this  area,  temporary  construction 
           fencing shall be erected within the project site at a minimum of 100 feet around the nest site. This 
           temporary  buffer  may  be  greater  depending  on  the  bird  species  and  construction  activity,  as 
           determined by the biologist. 

           Mitigation  Measure  BIO3:  At  the  discretion  of  the  biologist,  clearing  and  construction  within 
           the fenced area shall be postponed or halted until juveniles have fledged and there is no evidence 
           of  a  second  nesting  attempt.  The  biologist  shall  serve  as  a  construction  monitor  during  those

           periods  when  construction  activities  will  occur  near  active  nest  areas  to  ensure  that  no 
           inadvertent impacts on these nests will occur. 
b., c. d.  No  Impact.  The  site  is  completely  developed  and  does  not  contain  wetland  or  riparian  habitats. 
           The  project  site  is  completely  surrounded  by  residential  uses  to  the  east,  and  commercial  uses  to 
           the  north,  west,  and  south  and  therefore  does  not  provide  for  wildlife  movement  corridor  or  a 
           native wildlife nursery site. There would be no impact and no further analysis is required.  

e.         Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  The  City  of  San  Bruno  has  adopted  a  Heritage 
           Tree  ordinance  to  preserve  the  urban  forest  and  protect  trees  that  are  significant  to  the 
           community. According to the San Bruno Municipal Code, a tree is considered a Heritage Tree if it 
           meets any of the following criteria: 

           ·     Any  native  Bay  (Umbellularia  californica),  Buckeye  (Aesculus  species),  Oak  (Quercus  species), 
                 Redwood  (Sequoia  sempervirens),  or  Pine  (Pinus  radiata)  tree  that  has  a  diameter  of  6  inches  or 
                 more measured at 54 inches above natural grade; 

           ·     Any  tree  or  stand  of  trees  designated  by  resolution  of  the  City  Council  to  be  of  special 
                 historical value or of significant community benefit; 

           ·     A stand of trees, the nature of which makes each dependent on the others for survival; or 

           ·      Any  other  tree  with  a  trunk  diameter  of  10  inches  or  more,  measured  at  54  inches  above 
                 natural grade. 

           The proposed project would remove six trees including two pine trees (8inch and 12inchtrunk 
           diameter),  two  eucalyptus  trees  (24  inch  and  30  inch  trunk  diameter),  and  two  ornamental  trees 
           of  unknown  size.  According  to  the  Heritage  Tree  Ordinance,  defined  above,  three  of  the  trees 
           would  be  classified  as  Heritage  Trees.  Removal  of  or  damage  is  to  Heritage  Trees  would  be  a 
           potentially  significant  impact.  In  order  to  remove  a  Heritage  Tree,  a  tree removal permit must be 
           obtained  from  the  San  Bruno  Director  of  Public  Works  and  conditions  stipulated  by  the  permit 
           must  be  followed.  Adherence  to  the  San  Bruno  Heritage  Tree  Ordinance  and  implementation  of 
           Mitigation Measure BIO4 would reduce impacts to a less than significant level.  

           Mitigation  Measure  BIO4:  To  the  extent  possible,  project  design  should  avoid  removal  and 
           damage to Heritage Trees. For any Heritage Tree to be removed, a Heritage Tree Removal Permit 
           must  be  obtained  from  the  City  of  San  Bruno  before  a  Heritage  Tree  is  removed.  As  determined 
           by  the  City  of  San  Bruno  a  minimum  of  two  15inch  box  size  trees  shall  be  required  to  mitigate 
           the loss of each Heritage Tree. 

f.         No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  not  within  any  Habitat  Conservation  Plan,  Natural  Community 
           Conservation  Plan,  or  any  other  state,  regional,  or  local  conservation  plan  area.  Therefore,  no 
           impact would occur.

DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less than Significant Impact.   The  proposed  project  would  involve  the  demolition  and 
           redevelopment  of  an  existing  parking  lot  and  three  commercial  buildings.  A  historic  resource 
           evaluation was completed for the El Camino Theater by Kent L. Seavey. The report is included in 
           Appendix  B  of  this  document.  The  project  site  currently  contains  the  former  El  Camino  Theater 
           (Theater).  The  Theater  opened  in  1930  and  was  built  with  art  deco  architectural  details.  Historic 
           photographs  from  the  1940s  show  a  neon  marquee  above  the  recessed  entry  area.  The  entrance 
           was  flanked  by  two  retail  shops  with  large  plate  glass  windows.  A  photograph  from  1967  shows 
           a  vertical  neon  fin  above  the  neon  marquee,  in  the  art  deco  style.  The  Theater  remained  in 
           operation  until  the  1970s.  A  remodel  of  the  Theater  in  1978  removed  the  exterior  fin  above  the 
           marquee.  The  Theater  underwent  a  series  of  remodels  that  heavily  altered  the  exterior  and 
           interior through 2004, leaving the building in its current state.  

           According  to  the  historic  resource  evaluation,  the  Theater  was  a  visible  centerpiece  along  El 
           Camino  Real  and  drew  patrons  to  the  commercial  core  of  San  Bruno.  The  unique  art  deco 
           features  that  characterized  the  Theater  for  its  patrons  are  no  longer  present.  Key  historical 
           features  that  the  building  has  lost  include  the  marquee,  neon  fin,  and  recessed  entry  with  ticket 
           booth.  The  shaped  parapet  wall  fronting  El  Camino  Real  is  all  that  remains  of  the  historical 
           façade features.  

           Although  the  building  is  more  than  50  years  old,  the  modifications  that  have  occurred  since  the 
           1970s have removed most of the original art deco architectural components from the Theater. The 
           site  is  not  included  on  the  National  or  California  Register  of  Historical  Places.  In  addition,  the

           Theater  is  not  included  in  the  California  Office  of  Historic  Preservationmaintained  "Historic 
           Property  Data  Files  for  San  Mateo  County,"  or  any  San  Bruno  or  San  Mateo  County  historic 
           resource  inventories.  The  Theater  does not meet the necessary criteria for listing in the California 
           Register  of  Historical  Resources.  Therefore,  the  property  cannot  be  considered  an  historic 
           resource and the impact from the removal of this building is considered less than significant.  

b., c., d. Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  The  project  site  is  currently  developed  with  four 
           commercial  structures  and  a  surface  parking  lot.  Prior  construction  activities  would  have 
           resulted  in  the  discovery  and  either  curation  or  destruction  of  nearsurface  archaeological 
           resources or human remains, if any were present onsite. The proposed project would include the 
           demolition of the existing structures and surface parking lot and the construction of a threestory 
           commercial/residential  building. It is probable that construction activities, including grading and 
           excavation, would extend to depths greater than those required for the current structures. This in 
           turn  would  result  in  the  potential  for  the  discovery  of  archaeological  (including  human  remains) 
           or  paleontological  resources  below  levels  of  prior  disturbance.  Based  on  the  Historical  Resource 
           Inventory  prepared  for  the  San  Bruno  Redevelopment  Project,  there  is  a  low  probability  of 
           encountering human remains during construction activities. If any unrecorded cultural resources 
           are  uncovered  during  project  construction  activities,  the  following  mitigation  measure  would  be 
           implemented in order to reduce the impact to less than significant level.  

           Mitigation  Measure  CULT1:  If  archeological  or  paleontological  materials  are  identified,  work 
           on  that  portion  of  the  project  shall  cease  until  a  resource  protection  plan  conforming  to  CEQA 
           Section 15064.5 is prepared by a qualified archeologist or paleontologist and approved by the San 
           Bruno  Community  Development  Director  or  authorized  representative.  Project  work  may  be 
           resumed  in  compliance  with  such  plan.  If  human  remains  are  encountered,  the  County  Coroner 
           shall be contacted immediately and the provisions of State law carried out.

DISCUSSION: 

a.iiv, c. Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  The  project  site  is  located  in  the  San  Francisco 
          Bay  Area,  a  seismically  active  region,  and  as  such  is  exposed  to  some  risk  of  impacts  related  to 
          seismic  activity.  The  San  Andreas  Fault  is  located  about  1.5  miles  southwest  of  the  site.  The 
          Hayward  Fault  is  approximately  20  miles  east  of  the  site.  The  United  States  Geologic  Survey 
          (USGS)  has  determined  that  there  is  a  62  percent  probability  that  a  6.7  magnitude  earthquake 
          will  occur  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  before  the  year  2032  on  the  San  Andreas  or  Hayward 
          Fault.  

           The  project  site  is  not  within  a  designated  AlquistPriolo  Earthquake  Fault  Zone  and  there  is  no 
           potential for fault rupture on the project site.  
           According  to  the  Association  of  Bay  Area  Governments  (ABAG)  the  project  site  would 
           experience  violent  ground  shaking  if  a  magnitude  7.9  earthquake  occurred  along  the  San 
           Andreas  Fault  (ABAG  2004).  Ground  shaking  from  a  moderate  to  strong  earthquake  could 
           generate  ground  acceleration  at  the  project  site  that  could  cause  damage  to  structures,  utilities, 
           and unsecured objects. Damage from earthquakes could include cracks in walls and pavement. 
           Although  some  damage  from  earthquakes  is  unavoidable,  building  codes  and  standards  have 
           been  developed  to  protect  people  and  structures  during  earthquake  events.  The  project  site  is 
           located  within  Seismic  Zone  4  as  designated  in  the  California  Uniform  Building  Code  (UBC). 
           Compliance  with  UBC  requirements  for  development  in  seismic  zone  4  would  ensure  that  the 
           proposed project would be protected from most earthquake events. 
           Soils in the eastern portion of the City have a moderate potential for liquefaction due to historical 
           filling  of  San  Francisco  Bay  Mud  that  occurred  in  the  early  20th  century.  Liquefaction  is  caused 
           when  soil  subjected  to  ground  shaking  suddenly  loses  strength  due  to  increased  water  pressure. 
           However,  as  discussed  above,  compliance  with  the  UBC  would  minimize  impacts  associated 
           with ground movement from liquefaction. 
           Finally,  as  the  project  site  and  its  vicinity  are  located  on  relatively  flat  land  with  no  substantial 
           slopes nearby, there is a less than significant impact related to landslides. 
           Mitigation  Measure  GEO1:  Prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  building  permit  for  the  proposed 
           project,  the  applicant  shall  submit  a  geotechnical  report  prepared  by  a  licensed  geotechnical 
           engineer  to  the  Building  Department.  The  report  shall  provide  specific  design  level 
           recommendations  to  mitigate  any  geologic  hazards.  The  recommendation  of  the  report  shall  be 
           incorporated into the project design, and implemented as part of the proposed project. 
b.         Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  Construction  of  the  proposed  project  would 
           involve  demolition,  excavation,  grading,  and  compaction.  Given  the  existing  topography  of  the 
           site,  minimal  erosion  would  occur.  Because  the  project  site  is  about  1  acre,  coverage  under  the 
           National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NPDES)  General  Permit  for  storm  water 
           discharge  from  construction  activities  is  not  required.  However,  to  ensure  that  soil  erosion  from

d.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  site  is  mainly  situated  on  soils  of  the  Orthents 
           complex, 0 to 5 percent slope, with cut and fill material (NRCS 2007). This soil type is considered 
           to  have  a  low  expansive  potential.  Additionally,  according  to  the  City's  General  Plan,  the  project 
           site  is  not  in  an  area  considered  to  have  expansive  soils.  Therefore,  this  impact  is  considered  less 
           than significant.  
e.         No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  currently  surrounded  by  developed  land  uses  and  sewers  are 
           available  for  the  disposal  of  wastewater.  Therefore,  implementation  of  the  project  would  not 
           require the construction of septic tanks for wastewater disposal. No impact would occur.

DISCUSSION: 

a., d.     Less  than  Significant  impact.  The  project  would  be  subject  to  both  state  and  federal  laws 
           pertaining to hazardous materials and wastes.  

           The  project  includes  residential  and  commercial  land  uses.  Residential  uses  generally  do  not 
           involve  the  transport,  use,  or  disposal  of  significant  volumes  of  hazardous  substances.  Storage 
           and  use  of  hazardous  materials  within  the  residential  portion  of  the  project  would  involve  small 
           volumes  of  typical  household  cleaning  agents,  paints  and  other  building  material  finishing 
           products,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  automotive  engine  and  transmission  cleaning  agents,  lubricants, 
           etc. Such uses of hazardous materials do not generate hazardous air emissions and rarely, if ever, 
           involve  the  use  of  acutely  hazardous  materials  that  could  pose  a  significant  threat  to  the 
           environment or human health.  

           Hazardous  wastes  associated  with  residential  uses  typically  involve  empty  or  partially  filled 
           containers  of  liquid  chemical  products,  fertilizers,  used  motor  oil,  automotive  or  electronic 
           batteries,  unused  computers,  etc.  Residents  typically  dispose  of  such  wastes  through  the 
           County's Household Hazardous Waste Program that offers free collection of hazardous materials 
           to  County  residents.  No  significant  environmental  or  human  health  hazards  are  expected  to 
           occur in connection with the residential uses allowed by the project. 

           A  range  of  retail  and  service  businesses  could  occupy  the  commercial  portion  of  the  site. 
           Compliance  with  the  federal  and  state  laws  would  reduce  the  impact  of  use,  transport,  or 
           disposal of any hazardous materials to a less than significant level. 

           Storage of hazardous chemical materials (such as cleaning agents and lubricants) by businesses is 
           regulated  by  the  San  Mateo  County  Department  of  Public  Works.  Regulations  include  the 
           submittal  of  a  Hazardous  Materials  Business  Plan  showing  the  manner  in  which  chemical 
           products  would  be  stored  safely,  a  complete  list  of  chemical  products  that  would  be  kept  on  site, 
           and  an  accident  prevention  and  response  plan  to  deal  with  accidental  events  that  involve  some 
           kind  of  release  of  hazardous  materials  in  the  environment.  Compliance  with  those  regulations  is 
           mandatory,  and  is  enforced  through  annual  recertification  of  the  Plan.  With  these  existing 
           restrictions,  the  commercial  uses  allowed  by  the  project  would  not  result  in  a  significant  hazard 
           involving the use, transport, storage, use, or disposal of hazardous materials.

                                                                           6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           The  project  site  is  not  listed  on  the  Cortese  or  any  other hazardous waste and substances site list, 
           and  is  not  considered  to  be  hazardous  materials  site  (DTSC  2007).  Therefore  the  proposed 
           project's impacts are considered less than significant. 

b.         Less  than  Significant  with  Mitigation.  Due  to  the  age  of  the  existing  structures  on  the  site,  the 
           structures  are  expected  to  contain  asbestos  and  leadbased  pain.  Therefore,  demolition  of  the 
           existing  structures  could  expose  asbestoscontaining  materials  (ACM)  to  onsite  construction 
           workers  during  demolition  activities.  Section  19827.5  of  the  California  Health  and  Safety  Code 
           requires  that  local  agencies  not  issue  demolition  or  alteration  permits  until  an  applicant  has 
           demonstrated  compliance  with  notification  requirements  under  applicable  federal  regulations 
           regarding  hazardous  air  pollutants,  including  asbestos.  The  BAAQMD  is  vested  with  authority 
           to  regulate  airborne  pollutants  through  both  inspection  and  law  enforcement,  and  is  to  be 
           notified  10  days  in  advance  of  any  proposed  demolition  or  abatement  work.  The  local  office  of 
           the  State  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  must  also  be  notified  of 
           asbestos  abatement  to  be  carried  out.  Leadbased  paint  is  considered  hazardous  if  the  lead 
           content  exceeds  1,000  parts  per  million.  OSHA  regulates  worker  exposure  during  construction 
           through  respiratory  protection,  protective  clothing,  and  hygiene  facilities.  Implementation  of 
           Mitigation  Measures  HAZ1  and  HAZ2  would  ensure  that  the  impact  related  to  potential 
           exposure to ACM and leadbased paint would be reduced to a less than significant level. 

           Mitigation  Measure  HAZ1:  The  project  applicant  shall  conduct  a  leadbased  paint  survey,  and 
           if found, a leadbased paint abatement plan shall be prepared consistent with the following: 

           Approvals shall be secured from the City of San Bruno and the San Mateo County Department of 
           Environmental Health and included in the abatement plan; and 

           A  Health  and  Safety  Plan,  consistent  with  OSHA  requirements  shall  be  prepared  and 
           implemented; and 

           Removal of all leadbased paint in the areas of the buildings where the lead content exceeds 1,000 
           parts  per  million  shall  be  completed  comprehensively  as  part  of  demolition  activities,  and  the 
           project  applicant  shall  ensure  that  all  leadbased  paint  removed  as  part  of  demolition  is  properly 
           disposed of. 

           Mitigation  Measure  HAZ2:  Any  building  proposed  for  demolition  shall  require  BAAQMD 
           review  and  authorization  prior  to  the  issuance  of  a  demolition  permit  from  the  City.  The  City 
           Building  Division  shall  review  the  permit  application  and  require  the  applicant  to  secure  the 
           services  of  a  licensed  and  certified  asbestos  inspector  to  perform  a  comprehensive  site  survey, 
           and if necessary, removal of ACMs found.  

           These  measures  would  be  required  through  the  permit  review  process.  Implementation  of  these 
           measures  would  ensure  that  any  potential  impacts  due  to  asbestos  would  be  reduced  to  a  less 
           than significant level. 

c.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  There  are  several  public  and  private  schools  within  0.25  mile  of 
           the  project  site.  These  include  California  Montessori  School,  approximately  1,000  feet  from  the 
           site; Belle Air Elementary School, approximately 1,400 feet to the northeast; and Decima M. Allen 
           Elementary  School,  approximately  1,400  feet  to  the  northwest.  However,  the  proposed  project

0944001                                                                                                                 June 2008 
                                                                            6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           would  not  emit  hazardous  materials,  and  any  potential  storage  of  hazardous  materials  would  be 
           regulated through federal, state, and local regulations. The impact would be less than significant. 

e.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  site  is  about  1  mile  west  of  the  San  Francisco 
           International Airport (SFO), and lies within the boundaries of the Airport/Land Use Plan for SFO. 
           Due  to  the  existing  configuration  of  the  runway,  the  project  site  is  not  directly  within  takeoff  or 
           approach  pathways.  The  project  would  be  consistent  with  height  regulations  as  well  as  safety 
           guidelines  outlined  in  the  SFO  Airport/Land  Use  Plan.  Therefore,  this  impact  is  considered  less 
           than significant. 

f.         No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  not  located  in  the  vicinity  of  a  private  airstrip.  Therefore, 
           implementation  of  the  project  would  not  result  in  any  safety  hazards  related  to  private  airstrips. 
           There would be no impact. 

g.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  proposed  project  would  be  implemented  in  accordance  with 
           City  requirements  regarding  adequate  police,  fire,  and  emergency  access  to  the  site.  Therefore, 
           the  proposed  project  would  not  interfere  with  any  existing  emergency  response  or  evacuation 
           plan and this impact is considered less than significant. 

h.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  site  is  located  in  an  urbanized  area,  surrounded  by 
           residential  and  commercial  uses.  There  are  no  wildlands  adjacent  to  the  site.  The  proposed 
           project  would  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  fire  regulations.  Therefore,  the 
           project  would  not  expose  people  or  structures  to  significant  risks  associated  with  wildland  fires. 
           This impact is considered less than significant.

DISCUSSION:  

a., c.f.  No  Impact.  Water  quality  is  regulated  by  both  state  and  federal  agencies  under  the  authority  of 
          the  Federal  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  PorterCologne  Act.  Projects  that  have  the  potential  to 
          degrade  water  quality  are  subject  to  the  regulations  of  federal  and  state  agencies.  Operational 
          activities  at  the  project  site  may  involve  common  urban  pollutants  such  as  surface  litter,  oil, 
          gasoline,  grease,  paint,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  and  herbicides.  Construction  activities  such  as 
          excavation,  demolition,  stockpiling,  and  grading  activities  could  result  in  increased  erosion  and 
          could produce storm water runoff that could degrade water quality. 

           The  project  site  is  located  in  an  urbanized  area  and  would  include  impervious  surfaces  and 
           landscaping  similar  in  nature  to  existing  on  and  offsite  conditions.  An  onsite  stormwater 
           collection  system  would  be  constructed  to  collect  stormwater  and  discharge  it  to  the  existing 
           storm drainage system within San Mateo Avenue. 

           The  existing  drainage  system,  composed  of  roof  drains  and  sheet  flow,  directs  runoff  to  drain 
           inlets  in  San  Mateo  Avenue.  Some  runoff  is  captured  onsite  by  landscaping  or  directed  to  storm 
           drains  along  Taylor  and  Mastick  Avenue  and  El  Camino  Real.  San  Bruno's  storm  drainage 
           system  serves  the  entire  City,  collecting  and  channeling  all  runoff  into  Crystal  Springs  Reservoir 
           and  north  channels  which  carry  it  to  the  Bay  (General  Plan  1984).  The  existing  project  site 
           drainage  pattern  would  not  be  changed  by  project  implementation.  There  would  be  no  increase 
           in  impervious  surface  because  the  project  site  is  fully  developed  with  either  buildings  or  paved 
           parking  areas.  The  site  would  discharge  stormwater  at  a  rate  no  greater  than  the  site's  existing 
           discharge  rate.  The  runoff  would  continue  to  be  accommodated  by  the  existing  storm  water 
           system,  thereby  preventing  flooding  on  or  off  site.  Impacts  related  to  erosion,  siltation, 
           flooding, or capacity would be less than significant. 
            
           Stormwater  runoff  water  quality  is  regulated  by  the  National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination 
           System  (NPDES)  Program  (established  through  the  Clean  Water  Act).  The  NPDES  program 
           objective  is  to  control  and  reduce  pollutants  to  water  bodies  from  surface  water  discharges. 
           Locally,  the program is administered by the RWQCB. The RWQCB issued the San Mateo County 
           Countywide  Stormwater  Pollution  Prevention  Program  (STOPPP)  a  municipal  NPDES  permit. 
           The  STOPPP  maintains  compliance  with  the  NPDES  Storm  Water  Discharge  Permit  and

           promotes  storm  water  pollution  prevention  within  that  context.  Compliance  with  the  NPDES 
           Permit is mandated by State and federal statutes and regulations. 
            
           Participating  agencies  (including  the  City  of  San  Bruno)  must  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the 
           County permit by ensuring that new development and redevelopment mitigate, to the maximum 
           extent  practicable,  water  quality  impacts  to  stormwater  runoff  both  during  construction  and 
           operation periods of projects. Required permit provisions are detailed in RWQCB Order R22003
           0023. The proposed project would be subject to Provision C.3, which requires: 

           ·     Numeric  Sizing  Criteria  for  Pollutant  Removal  Treatment  Systems.  The  project  must 
                 include  source  controls,  site  design  measures,  and  treatment  controls  to  minimize 
                 stormwater  pollutant  discharges.  Pollution  treatment  controls  shall  be  sized  to  treat  the 
                 volume  of  annual  runoff  required  to  achieve  80  percent  or  more  capture  of  average  annual 
                 runoff  (in  the  Bay  Area  this  is  equivalent  to  having  the  capacity  to  repetitively  treat  storm 
                 events of about 1 inch of precipitation). 

           ·     Operation  and  Maintenance  of  Treatment  Measures.  Treatment  controls  often  do  not  work 
                 unless  adequately  maintained.  The  permit  requires  an  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M) 
                 program. 

           ·     Limitation  on  Increase  of  Peak  Stormwater  Runoff  Discharge  Rates.  Urbanization  creates 
                 impervious  surfaces  that  reduce  the  landscape's natural ability to absorb water and release it 
                 slowly  to  creeks.  These  impervious  surfaces  increase  peak  flows  in  creeks  and  can  cause 
                 erosion  (referred  to  as  hydromodification).  Projects  must  evaluate  the  potential  for  this  to 
                 occur and provide mitigation as necessary. 

           Most  of  the  parking  area  would  be  covered,  and  would  minimally  contribute  to  increases 
           associated  with  stormwater.  Furthermore,  to  mitigate  any  potential  adverse  impacts  associated 
           with  stormwater  runoff  during  construction  and  operation,  the  project  sponsor  would  be 
           required  to  develop  and  implement  BMPs  consistent  with  the  San  Mateo  County's  Stormwater 
           Pollution  Prevention  Program  (STOPPP),  which  would  minimize  potential  erosion  and 
           sedimentation.  STOPPP  requires  the  use  of  BMPs  to  control  erosion  associated  with  grading, 
           trenching, and other ground surfacedisturbing activities. 

           The  proposed  project  would  also  be  required  to  comply  with  Chapter  10.18  of  the  San  Bruno 
           Municipal  Code  (Storm  Water  Management  and  Discharge  Control),  which  outlines  minimal 
           requirements  aimed  at  reducing  the  amount  of  pollutants  in  stormwater.  These  requirements 
           would apply during project construction and operation. The project site is not currently subject to 
           the requirements of a waste discharge permit, which is required for any commercial or industrial 
           source  that  has  the  potential  to  discharge  wastewater  into  land,  sewers,  or  a  treatment  facility. 
           The  proposed  project  would  not  introduce  improvements  or  activities  that  would  be  subject  to 
           the  requirements  of  an  existing  or  new  water  discharge  permit.  Implementation  of  the  proposed 
           project  would  not  violate  any  waste  discharge  requirements.  Therefore,  there  would  be  no 
           impact. No mitigation is required. 

b.         No  Impact.  The  primary  source  of  water  for  the  City  of  San  Bruno  is  the  San  Francisco  Public 
           Utilities  Commission  (SFPUC)  HetchHetchy  system,  supplemented  by  other  surface  water 
           collection  systems.  The  City  also  maintains  a  water  well  system.  The  well  system  serves  portions

           of  the  city  generally  east  of  I280,  and  the  western  portion  of  the  city  is  serviced  by  the  SFPUC. 
           The  project  would  not  reduce  the  amount  of  groundwater  otherwise  available  for  public  water 
           supplies  because  groundwater  is  not  used  for  public  water  supplies  in  the  City  of  San Bruno. No 
           impacts to groundwater would occur.  
 
g.i.       No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  not  located  within  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency's 
           (FEMA) Flood Zone A (100year flood zone). Therefore, there would be no impact. 

j.         No  Impact.  Active  faults  within  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  have  largely  horizontal  movement 
           and  are  not  expected  to  generate  significant  water  waves  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay.  The  City  of 
           San Bruno`s location on the south west shore of the San Francisco Bay effectively shields the City 
           from  tsunamis.  Given  the  elevation  and  distance  of  the  project  site  from  the  bay's  edge,  the 
           potential  for  flooding  from  a  seiche  would  be  minimal.  Given  the  topography  of  the  project  site, 
           there would be minimal impacts from mudflows. Therefore, implementation of the project would 
           result in no impact related to the risk of inundation from seiche, tsunami, or mudflow.

DISCUSSION: 

a., b.     No Impact. The project site is located in the eastern portion of the City. Land uses adjacent to the 
           project  site  and  in  the  project  vicinity  consist  of  singlefamily  residences  and  commercial  uses. 
           The  site  is  bordered  to  the  east  by  singlefamily  residences.  The  other  surrounding  land  uses 
           around  the  project  site  are  commercial.  The  site  is  located  on  the  corner  of  San  Mateo  Avenue 
           and  Taylor  Avenue  and  has  historically  been  an  area  of  a  wide  variety  of  commercial  use.  The 
           proposed  project  would  increase  the  development  intensity  at  the  site  and  would  improve  the 
           surrounding  environment  by  establishing  a  new  residential  and  commercial  community  on 
           underutilized land. The project would introduce residential and commercial land uses on the site 
           that would be compatible with adjacent existing residential neighborhoods. Therefore, the project 
           would not physically divide a community.  

           The  applicable  land  use  plan  is  the  City  of  San  Bruno  General  Plan.  The  General  Plan  land  use 
           designation  of  the  site  is  Neighborhood/Commercial,  and  the  current  onsite  zoning  is  Central 
           Business  District  (CBD)  and  Lowdensity  Residential  (R2).  The  mixeduse  characteristic  of  the 
           project  would  provide  commercial  and  residential  uses  and  would  allow  for  integration  into  the 
           existing  area  by  providing  a  transition  from  commercial  uses  to  the  west,  north,  and  south  to 
           residential  uses  to  the  east.  Therefore,  no  impacts  would  occur.  Additionally,  the  project  site  is 
           within  the  SFO  Airport/Land  Use  Plan,  as  determined  by  the  San  Mateo  County  Airport  Land 
           Use Commission. The project would be consistent with the applicable regulations as presented in 
           the  SFO  Airport/Land  Use  Plan,  including  limitations  on  building  height.  No  impact  would 
           occur.  

c.         No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  not  within  the  purview  of  any  habitat conservation plan or natural 
           community  conservation  plan,  nor  would  the  proposed  activity  or  development  affect  any  area 
           so designated, directly or indirectly. Therefore, no project impact would occur.

DISCUSSION: 

a.b.       No  Impact.  According  to  the  State  of  California  Department  of  Mines  and  Geology,  Mineral 
           Resource  Zones  and  Resource  Sectors  map,  the  project  site  is  located  in  an  area  designated  as 
           MRZ1.  This  designation  refers  to  an  area  "where  adequate  information  indicates  that  no 
           significant  mineral  deposits  are  present,  or  where  it  is  judged  that  little  likelihood  exists  for  their 
           presence."  Therefore,  implementation  of  the  project  would  not  impact  mineral  resources  and  no 
           further analysis is required.

 DISCUSSION: 

a.           Less  than  Significant  Impact  with  Mitigation.  The  City  of  San  Bruno  General  Plan  states  that 
             residential  land  uses  should  only  be  exposed  to  ambient  noise  levels  less  than  65  decibels  (dB) 
             Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) which is an average equivalent noise level over a 24
             hour  period.  Commercial  land  uses  are  allowed  to  be  exposed  to  noise  levels  less  than  70  db 
             CNEL.  

             The  San  Bruno  General  Plan  states  that  many  residences  in  the  northeasterly  portion  of  the  City 
             are  exposed  to  noise  levels  within  a  65  to  70  dB  CNEL  and  70  to  75  dB  CNEL  range.  The  project 
             site  is  located  in  an  area  where  the  ambient  noise  levels  are  between  65  to  70  dB,  with  ambient 
             noise  levels  affected  by  noise  from  aircraft  associated  with  SFO  and  vehicular  traffic  along  El

                                                                             6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           Camino  Real.  These  ambient  levels  exceed  the  levels  allowed  for  residential  uses  by  the  General 
           Plan.  The  proposed  project  would  consist  of  48  residential  units  and  15,000  square  feet  of 
           commercial  space,  which  by  itself  is  not  anticipated  to  generate  noise  that  would  substantially 
           increase the ambient noise levels at the project site. 

           Project Operational Noise 

           The  proposed  project  would  generate  noise  from  its  daytoday  operation  from  motor  vehicle 
           trips  and  stationary  sources.  As  discussed  below  in  Section  6.15,  Transportation  and 
           Circulation,  the  proposed  project  would  generate  approximately  982  daily  trips  that  would  be 
           distributed over the various city streets that serve the project site. Traffic noise is not regulated by 
           local  agencies.  The  addition  of  these  trips  to  the  existing  traffic  volumes  in  the  project  vicinity  is 
           not expected to substantially raise ambient noise levels.  

           The  proposed  project  would  be  equipped  with  an  HVAC  system  with  the  exhaust  exiting  from 
           the  roof  of  the  building.  Noise  from  stationary  sources  such  as  the  proposed  HVAC  system 
           would be subject to noise ordinance standards. Section 6.16.060 of the San Bruno Municipal Code 
           states  "no  person  shall  operate  any  machinery,  equipment,  pump,  fan,  air  conditioning 
           apparatus,  or  similar  mechanical  device  in  any  manner  so  as  to  create  any  noise  which  would 
           cause the noise level at the property plane of any property to exceed the ambient base noise level 
           by more than ten decibels. However, during the period of 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM the ambient noise 
           level  may  be  exceeded  by  twenty  decibels  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  30  minutes  during  any 
           twenty four hour period." Given that the HVAC equipment associated with the proposed project 
           would  be  subject  to  the  City's  noise  ordinance  standards  described  above,  and  provided  that  the 
           equipment  is  designed  and  used  in  a  manner  that  complies  with  those  standards,  the  related 
           noise impact to onsite and adjacent residents would be less than significant. 

           To  ensure  that  the  project  residents  have  minimized  exposure  to  noise levels above 65 dB(A), the 
           following mitigation measure will be implemented: 

           Mitigation  Measure  NOISE1:  All  residential  units  shall  be  designed  to  include  sound 
           attenuation  features  to  achieve  a  maximum  interior  ambient  noise  level  below  65dB.  Prior  to  the 
           approval  of  the  final  building  inspection,  an  evaluation  shall  be  performed  by  a  qualified 
           professional  and  submitted  to  the  City  that  certifies  that  every  residential  unit  has  an  interior 
           ambient noise level less than 65dB(A) 

b.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  existing  noise  levels  at  the  project  site  are  discussed  above. 
           The  project  would  not  introduce  any  new  sources  of  groundborne  noise  or  vibration.  Also,  there 
           are  no  existing  sources  of  groundborne  noise  or  groundborne  vibration  at  or  around  the  site  to 
           which  future  occupants  of  the  project  would  be  exposed.  The  nearest  sources  of  groundborne 
           vibration and noise would be the Union Pacific Rail Road tracks, I280, I380, and SFO. However, 
           the  distance  from  the  project  site  to  these  sources  would  attenuate  any  groundborne  noise  or 
           vibration  before  it  reached  the  project  site.  Construction  activities  associated  with  the  project, 
           including excavation as part of the parking area would produce minimal groundborne noise and 
           vibration because no pile driving would occur. Therefore, the impact with respect to this criterion 
           is less than significant.

c.         Less than Significant Impact.   A  change  in  noise  levels  of  less  than  3  dBA  is  not  discernible  to 
           the  general  population;  an  increase  in  average  noise  levels  of  3  dBA  is  considered  barely 
           perceptible, while an increase of 5 dBA is considered readily perceptible to most people (Caltrans 
           1998).  The  proposed  project  would  increase  longterm  noise  levels  in  the  project  area  due  to 
           vehicle  trips  associated  with  its  operation;  however  the  project's  incremental  increase  in  daily 
           vehicle  trips  is  not  expected  to  be  substantial  given  the  existing  roadway  conditions  (See 
           Transportation  and  Circulation).  The  noise  increase  from  vehicles  associated  with  the  proposed 
           project  is  anticipated  to  be  below  3  dBA.  The  HVAC  system,  which  would  be  located  on  the  roof 
           of  the  proposed  building,  would  be  designed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the  City's  noise 
           ordinance standards.  

           Therefore,  the  proposed  project  would  not  result  in  a  significant  permanent  increase  in  ambient 
           noise levels above the existing levels without the project. 

d.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Construction  of  the  proposed  project  would  temporarily  raise 
           noise  levels  in  the  project  vicinity.  During  construction  of  the  proposed  project,  noise  would  be 
           generated  from  construction  equipment  and  activities.  The  effect  of  construction  noise  would 
           depend  upon  how  much  noise  would  be  generated  by  construction  (i.e.,  construction  activities 
           and  equipment),  distance  between  construction  activities  and  the  nearest  noisesensitive 
           receptors,  and  the  existing  noise  levels  at  those  uses.  Table  2,  Typical  Commercial  Construction 
           Noise  Levels,  shows  typical  noise  levels  associated  with  construction  of  commercial  and 
           residential buildings.

                                                                            6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


 
           Noise  from  construction  activities  generally  attenuates  (decreases)  at  a  rate  of  6  to  7.5  dBA  per 
           doubling  of  distance.  However,  there  are  residential  units  located  adjacent  the  project  site.  The 
           City  Municipal  Code  regulates  the  hours  and  noise  levels  that  are  acceptable  for  construction 
           activities  for  nearby  sensitive  receptors.  According  to  Section  6.16.070,  construction  activities 
           must  not  exceed  85  dB  at  100  feet  from  the  construction  site  between  the  hours  of  7:00  AM  and 
           10:00 PM. Noise levels must not exceed 60 dB during the hours of 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM. This in 
           effect  limits  the  hours  of  construction  activity  from  7:00  AM  to  10:00  PM  and  the  proposed 
           project  would  adhere  to  these  time  restrictions.  As  shown  above,  typical  equipment  would 
           exceed  the  85  dB  construction  noise  threshold,  but  the  quieted  equipment  would  be  within  the 
           allowed  noise  level.  Therefore,  to  ensure  that  construction  activities  utilize  quieted  equipment, 
           the  following  mitigation  measure  would  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  project.  This  mitigation 
           measure  would  ensure  the  project  would  have  a  less  than  significant  impact  related  to 
           construction noise. 

           Mitigation  Measure  NOISE2:  To  reduce  daytime  noise  impacts  due  to  construction,  the 
           following measures shall be implemented: 

           ·     Equipment  and  trucks  used  for  project  construction  shall  utilize  the  best  available  noise 
                 control  techniques  (e.g.,  improved  mufflers,  equipment  redesign,  use  of  intake  silencers, 
                 ducts,  engine  enclosures,  and  acoustically  attenuating  shields  or  shrouds)  wherever  feasible; 
                 and 
           ·     Impact  tools  (e.g.,  jack  hammers,  pavement  breakers,  and  rock  drills),  if  any,  used  for project 
                 construction  shall  be  hydraulically  or  electrically  powered  wherever  possible  to  avoid  noise 
                 associated  with  compressedair  exhaust  from  pneumatically  powered  tools. However, where 
                 use  of  pneumatic  tools  is  unavoidable,  an  exhaust  muffler  on  the  compressedair  exhaust 
                 shall  be  used;  this  muffler  can  lower  noise  levels  from  the  exhaust  by  up  to  about  10  dBA. 
                 External  jackets  on  the  tools  themselves  shall  be  used  where  feasible,  which  could  achieve  a 
                 reduction  of  5  dBA.  Quieter  procedures  shall  be  used,  such  as  drills  rather  than  impact 
                 equipment, whenever feasible; and  
           Stationary noise sources shall be located as far from sensitive receptors as possible, and they shall 
           be  muffled  and  enclosed  within  temporary  sheds,  or  insulation  barriers  or  other  measures  shall 
           be incorporated to the extent feasible. 

e.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  As  mentioned  above,  the  project  site  is  located  in  a  65  to  70  dB 
           CNEL  noise  range  area.  There  are  existing  residents  adjacent  to  the  proposed  project  site 
           currently  exposed  to  those  levels  of  noise.  Therefore,  although  residents  and  employees  of  the 
           proposed  project  would  be  exposed  to  noise  levels  above  65  dBA;  those  noise  levels  are  part  of 
           the  existing  noise  levels  in  the  area.  The  proposed  project  is  not  expected  to  generate  noise  levels 
           that  exceed  the  3dBA  increase.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  project would not expose residents or 
           employees  to  excessive  noise  levels  above  the  existing  65  to  70  dBA  noise  levels.  Therefore,  this 
           impact is considered less than significant. 

f.         No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  not  located  within  the  vicinity  of  a  private  airstrip.  Therefore, 
           implementation  of  the  project  would  neither  impact  nor  be  affected  by  a  private  airstrip.  No 
           impact would occur.

    POPULATION AND HOUSING  Would the project: 

    a)  Induce  substantial  population  growth  in  an  area, 
        either  directly  (for  example,  by  proposing  new 
                                                                                                                               
        homes  and  businesses)  or  indirectly  (for  example, 
        through extension of roads or other infrastructure)? 

    b)  Displace  substantial  numbers  of  existing  housing, 
        necessitating  the  construction  of  replacement                                                                      
        housing elsewhere? 

    c)  Displace  substantial  numbers  of  people,

        housing elsewhere? 

 

DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  proposes  the  demolition  of  existing  onsite  structures 
           and  the  construction  of  48  dwelling  units  that  would  result  in  an  increase  in  the  City  of  San 
           Bruno's  resident  population.  The  project  would  provide  20  percent  of  the  residential  units  (8 
           units)  at  a  price  affordable  to  citizens  at  the  moderate  income  level  (as  determined  by  the  federal 
           Department  of  Housing  and  Community  Development).  The  proposed  project  would  provide 
           housing  opportunities  for  citizens  at  various  income  levels  and  at  a  location  that  would  provide 
           access to different transit modes and commercial spaces. 

           Based  on  an  average  household  size  of  2.743  persons  per  household  for  San  Bruno,  the  proposed 
           residential  units  could  result  in  an  increase  in  the  onsite  population  by  132  persons  (State  of 
           California  Department  of Finance 2006). This represents an increase of approximately 0.3 percent 
           of San Bruno's 2007 population of 42,145 (State of California Department of Finance, 2006).  

           ABAG projects that by 2010, the population within the City of San Bruno would increase to about 
           43,000 (ABAG 2007). The population increase attributed to the proposed project from 2007 would 
           account  for  approximately  15  percent  of  the  projected  population  growth  within  the  City 
           between  existing  (2007)  and  2010  conditions.  Given  that  the  city  is  builtout  and  there  are 
           primarily  infill  opportunities  for  new  housing  developments,  the  project  would  represent  a  key 
           development  in  terms  of  providing  housing  within  the  designated  redevelopment  area  and 
           providing below market rate housing. Therefore, the project's effect on population growth would 
           be considered less than significant (ABAG 2007).

                                                                             6.0  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts 


           The  California  Department  of  Finance  also  provides  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  housing  units 
           in  the  City  of  San  Bruno,  and  it  is  estimated  that  as  of  January  2007,  there  were  approximately 
           15,504  housing  units  within  the  City.  The  48  dwellings  units  proposed  by  the  project  would 
           result in an increase of about 0.3 percent in the total number of housing units in the City. 

           The  proposed  project  would  construct  approximately  15,000  square  feet  of  retail  space  on  the 
           ground  level.  Assuming  an  employment  rate  of  500  square  feet  per  employee,  the  project  would 
           generate  32  employees.  The  2005  total  jobs  for  the  city  were  13,860  and  the  city  is  expected  to 
           increase  in  employment  to  14,690  by  2010.  Additionally,  there  is  a  dental  office  at  the  project  site 
           that  is  currently  in  operation.  The  employment  at  this  office  is  5  employees.  Therefore, 
           implementation  of  the  project  would  result  in  a  net  increase  of  27  jobs.  The  project  would 
           represent  approximately  3  percent  of  the  anticipated  employment  increase  from  2005  to  2010. 
           Given  the  small  percentage  of  jobs  in  the  area,  it  is  anticipated  that  these  jobs  could  be  filled  by 
           local residents and there would not be a substantial amount of population growth due to the jobs 
           created by the proposed project. 

           The  project  site  is  situated  in  a  developed  area,  surrounded  by  existing  residential  and 
           commercial  areas  within  the  City.  The  project  applicant  is  proposing  to  demolish  the  former  El 
           Camino  Cinema  and  three  adjoining  commercial  buildings  and  construct  in  their  place  a  mixed
           use  threestory  commercial  and  residential  building  with  an  integrated  multilevel  parking 
           structure.  (See  Figure  2,  Conceptual  Site  Plan).  The  former  El  Camino  Cinema  building  is 
           currently  vacant  except  for  a  small  dental  office  that  would  be  vacated  prior  to  project 
           implementation.  The  project  would  not  extend  infrastructure  or  roadways  within  the  project 
           vicinity,  and  proposed  infrastructure  improvements  would  consist  of  upsizing  of  existing onsite 
           utilities.  The  project  does  not  propose  any  new  utility  connections  that  would  extend  to  any 
           undeveloped  sites.  Therefore,  the  project  would  not  indirectly  contribute  to  growth  and  this 
           impact is considered less than significant. 

b.c.       No  Impact.  The  project  site  is  located  at  the  former  El  Camino  Cinema,  and  onsite  buildings  are 
           currently  unoccupied  except  for  a  small  dental  office.  Therefore,  the  proposed  project  would  not 
           result  in  displacement  of  existing  housing  or  people,  and  would  not  necessitate  the  construction 
           of replacement housing elsewhere.

DISCUSSION: 

a.i.       Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Construction  of  the  new  building  and  the  addition  of  residents 
           and  employees  associated  with  the  proposed  project  would  increase  the  potential  need  for  fire 
           protection  services.  The  City's  closest  fire  station  to  the  project  site  is  located  at  555  El  Camino 
           Real,  approximately  1,500  feet  north  of  the  project  site.  The  Fire  Department  currently  has  two 
           fire  stations  (the  other  located  at  1177  Earl  Avenue),  33  fulltime  fire  fighters,  and  18  paramedics 
           (Devendorf  2007).  The  Fire  Department  has  indicated  that  implementation  of  the  proposed 
           project  would  not  require  any  new  fire  facilities,  equipment,  or  staff.  Response  times  to  the 
           project site are anticipated to be less than 3 minutes. Therefore, impacts of the proposed project in 
           relation to fire protection services would be less than significant.  

a.ii.      Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Construction  of  the  new  building  and  additional  residents  and 
           employees  associated  with  the  proposed  project  would  increase  the  potential  need  for  police 
           protection  services.  The  City's  Police  Department  is  located  at  1177  Huntington  Avenue, 
           approximately  1.5  miles  north  of  the  project  site.  The  Police  Department  currently  has  48  full
           time  officers,  20  staff  members,  and  maintains  a  staffing  ratio  of  1.2  officers  per  1,000  residents 
           (Catalano  2007).  The  Police  Department  has  indicated  that  implementation  of  the  proposed

           project  would  not  require  any  new  police  facilities,  equipment,  or  staff.  Response  times  to  the 
           project site are anticipated to be less than 5 minutes. Therefore, impacts of the proposed project in 
           relation to police protection services would be less than significant.  

a.iii.     Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Projectrelated  residential  population  increases  could  add  more 
           students  to  the  local  school  system.  The  San  Bruno  Park  School  District  is  responsible  for 
           elementary  and  middle  schools  and  the  San  Mateo  Union  High  School  District  is  responsible  for 
           high  schools  in  the  area.  The  nearest  schools  to  the  project  site  are  Decima  M.  Allen  Elementary 
           School  at  875  West  Angus  Avenue,  Belle  Air  Elementary  School  at  450  Third  Avenue,  Parkside 
           Intermediate at 1801 Niles Avenue, and Capuchino High School at 1501 Magnolia Avenue. 

           Using  student  generation  rates  of  0.5  elementary  students  and  0.2  high  school  students  per 
           household from the State Department of Education, the project would generate approximately 24 
           elementary  or  middle  school  children  and  10  highschool  students.  It  is  anticipated  that  the 
           potential  increase  in  student  enrollment  due  to  the  proposed  project  would  be  accommodated  in 
           the  existing  school  system.  Furthermore,  the  proposed  project  would  be  required  to  pay 
           mandatory  school  impact  fees,  pursuant  to  SB  50,  and  this  represents  full  mitigation  for  any 
           school  impacts.  Therefore,  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  in  relation  to  public  schools  would  be 
           less than significant.  

a.iv.      Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  City  Parks  and  Recreation  Services  Department  manages 
           several parks and activity centers. The closest facilities to the project site are the City Park at 1125 
           Crystal  Springs  Road,  approximately  1,500  feet  to  the  west,  and  Grundy  Park,  a  smaller  passive 
           park located near Park Avenue and Oak Avenue, approximately 0.5 mile northwest of the project 
           site. Additionally, Junipero Serra County Park is located approximately 1 mile west of the project 
           site and provides additional park facilities for residents of the area. 

           The  project  would  construct  48  multifamily  units  resulting  in  an  onsite  population  of 
           approximately  132  new  residents.  These  new  residents  are  not  expected  to  substantially  increase 
           the  demand  for  public  park  services,  including  maintenance.  Pursuant  to  the  City's  Municipal 
           Code  12.44.140,  the  project  applicant  would  be required to pay inlieu park fees to allow the City 
           to  fund  new  park  facilities.  The  fee  is  based  upon  the  market  value  of  the  residential  units.  This 
           fee  would  be  calculated  pursuant  to  the  City  code  at  the  time  that  the  final  subdivision  map  is 
           approved.  Compliance  with  this  City  standard  would  reduce  the  park  facility  impact  to  a  less 
           than significant level. 

a.v.       No Impact. No other governmental services would be affected by the proposed project.

     a)  Would  the  project  increase  the  use  of  existing 
         neighborhood  and  regional  parks  or  other 
         recreational  facilities  such  that  substantial  physical

         facilities,  which  might  have  an  adverse  physical 
         effect on the environment? 

 

DISCUSSION: 

a.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  Impacts  associated  with  the  increase  in  demand  for  parks  and 
           recreational  facilities  in  the  region  as  a  result  of  projectrelated  growth  in  residents  are  discussed 
           in  the  response  to  6.13a.iv,  "Parks,"  above.  Because  the  indirect  population  increase  associated 
           with  the  proposed  project  is  relatively  small,  increased  demand  for  recreational  facilities  that 
           could  cause  physical  deterioration  of  recreational  facilities  is  not  expected  to  occur  as  a  result  of 
           the proposed project. This impact is considered less than significant. 
b.         Less  than  Significant  Impact.  The  project  would  not  include  recreational  facilities.  The  City 
           currently  has  a  standard  for  parkland  ratio  of  4.5  acres  of  parks  per  1,000  residents.  Utilizing  the 
           DOF  population  estimate  of  42,145,  the  City  should  have  approximately  190  acres  of  parkland. 
           The  exiting  parkland  is  less  than  this  amount,  so  there  is  currently  a  deficiency  in  parkland  for 
           residents.  
 
           The proposed project would add approximately 132 new residents to the city who would require 
           park  services.  Based  on  the  City's  parkland  ratio,  the  project  would  require  0.6  acre  of  parkland. 
           As  the  project  does  not  contain  any  provision  for  parkland,  the  applicant  would  contribute  in
           lieu  fees  to  the  City  which  would  be  used  to  fund  future  improvements  to  existing  parks  or 
           contribute  to  development  of  new  recreational  facilities.  Therefore,  the  project  would  contribute 
           to the development or expansion of recreational facilities in the city.  
            
           Since  the  project  would  contribute  inlieu  fees,  the  project's  impacts  on  existing  recreational 
           facilities  would  be  less  than  significant  (see  the  response  to  6.13a.iv,  "Parks,"  above).  The  need 
           for  new  or  expanded  recreational  facilities  is  not  expected  to  be  a  result,  either  direct  or  indirect, 
           in  an  adverse  environmental  impact  on  the  environment.  Therefore,  this  impact  would  be  less 
           than significant.

DISCUSSION: 

a.b.       Less than Significant Impact. A traffic impact analysis was prepared for the proposed project by 
           DKS  Associates  in  February  2008,  and  is  included  in  Appendix  C  of  this  document.  The 
           proposed project would generate approximately 982 daily trips, with approximately 62 AM peak 
           hour  trips  and  86  PM  peak  hour  trips.  The  breakdown  of  vehicle  trips  generated  by  the  project's

           To  determine  the  project's  effect  on  existing  and  future  intersection  operations,  several  key 
           intersections  were  selected  for  impact  analysis.  The  existing  intersection  operations  and  delay 
           experienced  by  motorists  are  shown  below  in  Table  4,  Existing  Intersection  Operations.  The 
           operations  of  roadway  facilities  are  described  with  the  term  "level  of  service"  (LOS).  LOS  is  a 
           qualitative  description  of  traffic  flow  based  on  factors  such  as  speed,  travel  time,  delay,  and 
           freedom  to  maneuver.  Six  levels  of  service  are  defined  ranging  from  LOS  A  (i.e.,  best  operating 
           conditions)  to  LOS  F  (worst  operating  conditions).  LOS  E  corresponds  to  operations  "at 
           capacity."  When  traffic  volumes  exceed  an  intersection's  capacity,  stopandgo  conditions  result 
           and operations are designated as LOS F. The City considers LOS D to be the minimum acceptable 
           LOS. Therefore, if an intersection is operating at LOS E or LOS F, this is considered unacceptable. 
           For the purposes of CEQA, if a project caused an intersection currently operating at an acceptable 
           LOS to operate at an unacceptable LOS, this would be considered a significant impact.

           As  shown  above,  the  existing  intersections  near  the  project  site  are  all  operating  at  acceptable 
           levels.  

           As the proposed project would not be implemented until approximately 2010, recently approved, 
           pending  and  foreseeable  projects  were  included  in  the  future  conditions  analysis  for  the 
           proposed project. The future conditions analysis represents what the traffic environment is likely 
           to  be  operating  at  in  2010,  with  the  growth  that  would  occur  beyond  the  existing  conditions.  The 
           study  intersections  are  shown  below  in Table 5, Future (2010) Intersection Operations (Without 
           Project), and reflect existing plus future development that is anticipated for the City.

           The  future  conditions  data  show  that  there  would  be  no  change  in  intersection  operations  and 
           slight increases in delay experienced by motorists beyond that under the existing conditions. This 
           can  be  explained  by  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  future  development  that  would  add  only  a 
           small percentage of additional vehicle trips to the existing roadways. 

           Using  this  data  and  combining  it  with  traffic  associated  with  the  proposed  project,  changes  in 
           LOS  caused  by  implementation  of  the  proposed  project  were  estimated.  For  the  purposes  of 
           CEQA,  an  increase  in  delay  at  an  intersection  that  is  operating  at  acceptable  LOS  is  not 
           considered  a  significant  impact.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  shown  below  in  Table  6,  Future 
           (2010) Intersection Operations (Plus Project).

           As  shown  in  Table  6,  the  project  would  not  cause  a  significant  impact  related  to  LOS  levels.  The 
           project  would  cause  the  Mastick  Avenue  and  Taylor  Avenue  intersection  to  decline  from  LOS  A 
           to  LOS  B.  However,  LOS  B  is  still  considered  an  acceptable  LOS,  and  therefore  this  is  considered 
           a  less  than  significant  impact.  Given  the  existing  volume  of  vehicles  traveling  through  the  study 
           intersections,  the  project  would  not  add  significant  amounts  of  traffic  that  would  result  in  a 
           significant impact under 2010 conditions. 

           The traffic analysis prepared for the project also included a cumulative analysis through the year 
           2030. This analysis was based on the County of San Mateo's C/CAG travel demand model. 

           For  the  cumulative  scenario,  specific  link  traffic  volume  estimates  from  the  Countywide  traffic 
           model  were  provided  by  City  of  San  Bruno  Staff  for  the  years  2030  and  2005.  The  intersection 
           traffic  volumes  for  the  long  range  forecast  are  based  on  annual  growth  estimated  using  the  2005 
           and  2030  travel  demand  models.  The  growth  rates  were  applied  to  the  existing  traffic  counts  for 
           23  years  to  estimate  year  2030  conditions.  Trips  related  to  planned  and  approved  projects  were 
           assumed to be included in the year 2030 traffic model.

           Using  the  travel  demand  models,  an  annual  growth  rate  of  2.8  percent  and  2.5  percent  were 
           estimated  for  the  AM  and  PM  peak  periods  respectively.  The  growth  rates  were  applied  to  the 
           2007  traffic  count  data  for  23  years  to  estimate  2030  conditions.  For  the  weekday  and  weekend 
           midday  periods,  travel  demand  forecasts  are  not  available,  therefore  an  average  of  the  AM  and 
           PM  peak  period  growth  rates  was  applied  (2.66 percent). Based on the estimated traffic volumes, 
           and  using  analysis  methodology  similar  to  the  previously  analyzed  scenarios,  operating 
           conditions for the year 2030 conditions were estimated. Of the 10 study intersections, nine would 
           operate  at  LOS  D  or  better  during  the  AM  peak  hour,  and  five  would  operate  at  LOS  D  or  better 
           during  the  PM  peak  hour.  Intersections  that  are  projected  to  operate  at  LOS  E  or  F  were 
           considered to be cumulatively deficient.

           deteriorate to deficient levels during three of the four analysis periods for the Cumulative No
           Project scenario.

           During the AM peak hour, the intersection of Crystal Springs Road and Cunningham Road
           would deteriorate to a deficient LOS F. During the PM peak hour, five of the 10 study
           intersections would deteriorate to a deficient LOS E or F. All 10 study intersections are
           anticipated to operate at acceptable levels during the weekday midday period.

           During the weekend midday peak, the intersection of San Bruno Avenue and El Camino Real is
           anticipated to deteriorate to LOS E, and the intersection of the I-380 Westbound Off-Ramp at El
           Camino Real is anticipated to operate at a deficient LOS F.

           In comparison to the Cumulative No Project scenario, all of the study intersections would
           continue to operate at the same levels of service with the addition of project related trips. At
           intersections that are estimated to operate at deficient LOS E or F, the addition of project related
           traffic would result in average delay increases of less than two seconds. Therefore, the proposed
           project would not result in any significant cumulative impacts, nor significantly contribute to
           anticipated cumulative deficiencies. Table 8 provides a summary of the Cumulative plus Project
           scenario intersection service levels for each of the peak hours analyzed.

           The proposed project would not result in any potentially significant cumulative impacts at the
           study intersections.

           The City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) is the Congestion Management Agency
           (CMA) that sets the state and federal funding priorities for improvements affecting the San Mateo
           County Congestion Management Program (CMP) roadway system. C/CAG-designated CMP
           roadway system components near the project site include SR 82, and I-280. C/CAG established
           the level of service standard for major roadways in San Mateo County. Of the intersections
           studied for the proposed project, the San Bruno Avenue/El Camino Real intersection is the only
           studied intersection within the CMP. The LOS standard adopted by C/CAG for this intersection is
           LOS E. As discussed above, the additional project vehicle trips would not contribute substantially
           to the local roadway system and would not cause the intersection to degrade below LOS E.
           Therefore, project implementation would not individually or cumulatively exceed a level of
           service standard established by the CMP.

           There are four state highways in the vicinity of the project site; State Route 82 (El Camino Real),
           U.S. Route 101, I-280, and I-380. Because the proposed project is anticipated to generate less than
           100 net-new peak hour trips, a formal analysis of the routes of regional significance is not
           required. Therefore, the following is provided for informational purposes only.

           Based on the estimated trip generation and trip distribution patterns, each of the regional
           roadways would experience a slight increase in traffic from the proposed project when compared
           to the existing conditions. In general, the number of trips added to El Camino Real would be less
           than 25 vehicles per direction of travel to the north, and less than 12 to the south. On U.S. 101, I-
           280, or I-380, less than eight vehicles per hour due to the proposed project are anticipated in any
           direction of travel. No adverse impacts to the regional roadways are anticipated.

c.         Less than Significant Impact. The project would not affect the air traffic patterns at any of the
           regional airports. The proposed building height of the project does not exceed Federal Aviation
           Administration height restrictions related to SFO. Therefore, implementation of the project
           would result in a less than significant impact from the safety risks associated with air traffic
           patterns.
d.         Less than Significant Impact. The project would change on-site circulation and site access from
           existing conditions. Based on the current site plan, the access driveway to the garage is located on
           Mastic Avenue and the driveway would be approximately 30 feet wide at the curb flare outs. Per
           the City of San Bruno's Municipal Code, "The minimum width for single-family and multiple
           family residential driveways shall be twelve feet for single driveways and twenty-four feet for
           double driveways, measured at the face of the curb." Therefore, the project driveway access
           would satisfy the city requirement. This impact is considered less than significant

e., g.     Less than Significant Impact. The project would alter on-site circulation, and consequently
           emergency access may be affected. However, the City fire and police departments that would
           provide emergency services have indicated that the proposed project circulation would not cause
           any adverse impacts related to emergency access. The project site is approximately 0.5 mile from
           the San Bruno Caltrain station, a passenger rail service; approximately 1.0 mile from the San
           Bruno BART station, a regional public high speed rail service, and adjacent to a SamTrans bus
           stop, the bus system serving San Mateo County. Furthermore, the project would not conflict with
           any adopted policies, plans, or programs related to alternative transportation.

           C/CAG has established the level of service standard for major roadways in San Mateo County. As
           discussed above, the additional project vehicle trips would not contribute substantially to the
           local roadway system. Therefore, project implementation would not individually or cumulatively
           exceed a level of service standard established by the CMP.

f.         Less than Significant Impact. The City of San Bruno Municipal Code requires that residential,
           multi-dwelling units with one or more bedrooms have at least two covered parking spaces per
           unit plus 0.1 space per unit for guest parking. For general retail uses, the parking requirement is
           one space for every 250 square feet of gross floor area. With 48 dwelling units and approximately
           15,000 square feet of retail space, the proposed project would require 165 parking spaces. The
           project, however, qualifies for a density bonus under the State of California Density Bonus Law
           (SB 1818) due to the provision of affordable units. Cities and counties are required to grant
           "concessions or incentives" that reduce development standards, depending on the percentage of
           affordable units provided. In the case of this project, new parking standards are applied and they
           are as follows:

                Zero to one bedroom-one on-site parking spaces.
                Two to three bedrooms-two on-site parking spaces.
           These numbers are inclusive of guest parking and handicap parking. The project, which would
           include 13 three-bedroom units, 19 two-bedroom units, 14 one-bedroom units, and 2 studio units
           would require 152 total parking spaces (residential and retail) under the new parking standards
           as summarized in Table 9, Parking Conditions.

           Parking requirements for the proposed project may be further adjusted based on the fact that the
           existing buildings are non-conforming structures for which the number of parking spaces
           provided is less than required per San Bruno Municipal Code 12.92.020.C. The Municipal Code
           allows such nonconformity to continue provided that the physical change, enlargement,
           extension does not increase the nonconformity. In addition, the subject site is located within a
           downtown parking assessment district which provides for the reduction or elimination of off-
           street parking requirements if the Planning Commission finds that the parking needs for the
           particular structure or use are substantially met by the parking spaces provided in the district
           (Section 12.100.120.B).

           Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Parking Generation Manual, 3rd Edition,
           2004, the estimated average peak parking demand for residential condominiums/townhouses is
           1.46 spaces per unit. For a shopping center (general or specialty retail uses were not included in
           the Manual), the Friday, Non-December average peak period parking demand is 3.02 spaces per
           1,000 square feet of gross leasable area. Transit service to a shopping center, however, was shown
           to reduce peak parking demand by up to 8 percent, based on limited data. Since the proposed
           project is in a downtown setting that includes a pedestrian and transit-oriented environment, the
           8 percent reduction in estimated peak parking demand could be applied. This would result in a
           total demand of approximately 112 parking spaces (70 residential and 42 retail).

           The proposed condominium and retail development would have 104 basement parking spaces
           and 48 ground level parking spaces. The proposed off-street parking supply of 152 parking
           spaces would not meet the City of San Bruno parking requirements. With the State Density Bonus
           Law in effect, however, the project would meet and exceed the new parking requirements of 144
           spaces. In addition, the project would provide more spaces than the ITE estimated parking

           Additionally, on-street parking in the vicinity of the project is very limited. Eight parallel parking
           spaces which are free but limited to one hour are provided off of San Mateo Avenue directly
           adjacent to the project site. These spaces are typically used by downtown visitors coming from
           outside of the immediate area. On Mastick Avenue, there are approximately eight parallel
           parking spaces, also free, located behind the project site on the far side (east side) of the street.
           These spaces are most likely utilized by the adjacent residential uses or downtown visitors. On-
           street parking is also available, for free, on Mastick Avenue south of Taylor Avenue, and Taylor
           Avenue east of Mastick Avenue. There are also 25 spaces available on a city-owned lot located on
           Mastick Avenue, adjacent to the project site. These spaces are free and are open to all downtown
           visitors.

           Most residents and visitors to the project site are anticipated to use the provided off-street
           parking spaces.

DISCUSSION:

a., e.     Less than Significant Impact. The City of San Bruno Public Works Department is the primary
           provider of sanitary sewer services in the city. The City is responsible for maintenance of its
           wastewater collection system and compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations
           related to wastewater. The City utilizes the South San Francisco/San Bruno Water Quality Control
           Plant (WQCP), where the treatment of wastewater is handled under a Joint Powers Agreement
           with the City of South San Francisco. The WQCP is located at 195 Belle Air Road, north of the San

0944-001                                                                                                      June 2008
                                                                    6.0 Evaluation of Environmental Impacts


           Francisco International Airport (SFO), and is operated and maintained by the City of South San
           Francisco. Secondary treated wastewater is discharged into San Francisco Bay via a 60-inch
           outfall pipe 2 miles offshore, which is shared by the cities of San Bruno, South San Francisco,
           Millbrae, Burlingame, Colma, and SFO. The WQCP also receives wastewater from Colma and
           Daly City and has total dry-weather capacity of 13 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd)
           and a wet-weather capacity of approximately 62 million gallons per day. The current dry weather
           flows at the WQCP average approximately 10 mgd and wet weather flows average approximately
           30 mgd. The City currently pumps approximately 3.4 million gallons of effluent per day to the
           WQCP, which is 34 percent of this total current effluent, during dry weather conditions.

           The average per capita generation factor for single-family and multi-family units is 75 gpd, and
           the generation factor for commercial uses is 10 gpd/100 square feet. Using this estimate, and 132
           as the approximate number of new residents generated by the project site and 15,000 square feet
           of commercial space, the proposed residential development would generate approximately 9,900
           gpd and the proposed commercial space would generate approximately 1,600 gpd. The project
           site currently has some commercial uses generating wastewater. Therefore, the project would
           result in a net increase of about 10,425 gpd, or about 0.3 percent of the City's current contribution
           to the WQCP. The volume of wastewater anticipated by the project is incremental and would not
           be expected to exceed the wastewater treatment requirements of the Regional Water Quality
           Control Board.

           According to the City of San Bruno, portions of the City's existing sanitary sewer lines serving
           the project site are undersized for the proposed land uses. The project sponsor would ensure that
           all sanitary sewer lines serving the project would be sufficiently upgraded to accommodate the
           proposed project during dry and wet weather conditions. These upgrades would replace the
           existing wastewater lines and would be constructed in city streets, in areas already disturbed in
           conjunction with previous construction projects. For these reasons, the project's impact to
           sanitary sewer would be less than significant.

b., d.     Less than Significant Impact. The City's Water Division (within the Public Works Department)
           is responsible for the operation, distribution, and maintenance of the City's water utilities. The
           City delivers approximately 4.2 million gallons of water per day to 11,300 metered residential
           users, businesses, and institutions. The City receives about half of its water from four local wells,
           which draw potable water from the Westside Groundwater Basin, an aquifer located between
           250 feet and 500 feet below ground surface. The City's second source of water is the San Francisco
           Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), which obtains about 90 percent of its water from the
           Hetch-Hetchy Aqueduct, located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The water from the Hetch-
           Hetchy Aqueduct is transported 150 miles through various pipelines to supply the City of San
           Francisco and other cities on the Peninsula. The City of San Bruno and the SFPUC signed a Water
           Supply Contract in 1984 that guarantees 3.246 million gallons per day of water from the Hetch-
           Hetchy system.

           The proposed project would increase the demand for water on the project site and, therefore,
           slightly increase the water demand in the City. Assuming approximately 132 new residents on
           the project site and approximately 15,000 square feet of commercial land uses, the proposed
           project would require approximately 15,000 to 23,000 gallons of water per day (San Bruno Public
           Works Department 2007). The anticipated water demand for the project would constitute
           approximately 0.34 to 0.57 percent of the City's current water demand of 4.2 million gallons per
           day. Similar to the wastewater lines, the water lines serving the project site would be upgraded

           by the applicant to ensure adequate capacity for residential and commercial demand as well as to
           meet fire flow requirements. These proposed improvements would replace the existing water
           lines and would up-size the lines as needed. All construction would occur in city streets, in areas
           previously disturbed by other construction projects.

           Since the projected water demand is anticipated to be a small percentage of the City's total
           demand and that no new supply facilities would need to be constructed as a result of this project,
           the project's impact on water provisions would be less than significant.

c.         Less than Significant Impact. The City Public Works Department operates and maintains the
           stormwater drainage system in San Bruno. Stormwater that enters the City's system flows
           through the underground pipes into Colma Creek, Crystal Springs Creek, Huntington Creek, and
           San Bruno Creek; from there all flows enter the San Bruno Channel, located north of SFO, and,
           ultimately, the San Francisco Bay.

           The project site includes impervious surfaces associated with the sidewalks and paved parking
           areas. The site also contains landscaping. Project development would increase impervious surface
           areas on the site; however, most of the parking area would be covered, and would minimally
           contribute to increases associated with stormwater. Furthermore, to mitigate any potential
           adverse impacts associated with stormwater runoff during construction and operation, the
           project sponsor would be required to develop and implement BMPs required by the San Mateo
           County's STOPPP, which would minimize potential erosion and sedimentation. STOPPP requires
           the use of BMPs to control erosion associated with grading, trenching, and other ground surface-
           disturbing activities.

           The proposed project would also be required to comply with Chapter 10.18 of the San Bruno
           Municipal Code (Storm Water Management and Discharge Control), which outlines minimal
           requirements aimed at reducing the amount of pollutants in stormwater. These requirements
           would apply during project construction and operation.

           Compliance with the SWPPP, Chapter 10.18 of San Bruno Municipal Code and the proposed
           design of the drainage system, would result in less than significant impacts to the stormwater
           drainage system.

f., g.     Less Than Significant Impact. The San Bruno Garbage Company (SBGC), a Norcal Company, is
           the exclusive solid waste and recycling collector for the City. SBGC transports solid waste to its
           transfer station, located at 101 Tanforan Avenue in San Bruno, where it is processed and sorted.
           The solid waste is then hauled to the Ox Mountain Landfill, located off of State Route 92 between
           Half Moon Bay and the City of San Mateo. The Ox Mountain Landfill has a permit from the
           California Integrated Waste Management Board to operate until 2018, with a total permitted
           capacity of 35.9 million cubic yards. The maximum daily waste tonnage that it is permitted to
           receive is 3,598 tons, which is approximately 1.3 million tons per year. The amount of waste (1.17
           tons per year/multi-family unit; 2.37 tons per year/1,000 square feet commercial space) generated
           by the proposed project on a annual basis would be approximately 94 tons and represents less
           than 3 percent of the total daily amount of solid waste the landfill is permitted to accept (CIWMB
           2007).
           Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939), passed in 1989, requires each city and county to include an
           implementation schedule to divert 50 percent of its solid waste from landfill disposal by January

           1, 2000, through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. As of 2002, the total
           annual waste diversion for San Bruno was approximately 41 percent.
           Whenever feasible, solid waste would be recycled for reuse to help the City to comply with AB
           939. In addition, at least 50 percent of construction waste would be recycled. Compliance with AB
           939 would result in less than significant impacts to solid waste. Additionally, the following
           mitigation measure is imposed to ensure residents of the proposed project have on-site recycling
           facilities.
           Mitigation Measure UTILS-1: The project applicant shall ensure that the trash area for the
           proposed residential portion of the project includes a dedicated area for recyclable materials.

     MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE

     a)   Does the project have the potential to degrade the
          quality of the environment, substantially reduce the
          habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or
          wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining
          levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal
          community, reduce the number or restrict the range
          of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate
          important examples of the major periods of
          California history or pre-history?

     b) Does the project have impacts that are individually
        limited,      but      cumulatively      considerable?
        ("Cumulatively considerable" means that the
        incremental effects of a project are considerable
        when viewed in connection with the effects of past
        projects, the effects of other current projects, and the
        effects of probable future projects.)

     c)   Does the project have environmental effects, which
          will cause substantial adverse effects on human
          beings, either directly or indirectly?


DISCUSSION:

a.         Less than Significant Impact. The project would not significantly impact biological resources
           that occur within the project site due to the surrounding land uses and mitigation measures that
           would be implemented with the proposed project. The project would involve tree removal.
           However, the mitigation measures identified for the proposed project would ensure that impacts
           associated with potential habitat within trees selected for removal would be less than significant.
           The project would not conflict with any local plans or policies protecting wildlife resource or
           conflict with any habitat conservation plans.

b.         Less than Significant Impact. Implementing the project would not substantially intensify the
           existing use on site. Construction associated with project development could have temporary
           impacts associated with increased noise levels, as identified in this Initial Study. These noise
           sources are temporary in nature and would not represent a cumulative significant increase in
           exterior noise levels. Project operation would not significantly increase noise, traffic, or air
           quality conditions above existing conditions. Furthermore, the area surrounding the project site is
           developed, and no other nearby development have been approved or are pending construction.
           For these reasons, the project would not considerably contribute to the effects of past, current, or
           future projects.

c.         Less than Significant Impact. The proposed project is not anticipated to have substantial direct
           or indirect effects on humans.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This  report  provides  an  evaluation  of  traffic  and  transportation  issues  related  to  the  proposed  mixed 
use development site located at 400418 San Mateo Avenue in the City of San Bruno, California.  The 
proposed  project  consists  of  fortytwo  condominium  units  and  15,800  square  feet  of  retail  space.  
The  project  site  is  currently  occupied  by  a  dental  office  at  the  former  cinema  building  and  various 
other vacant commercial uses. 

The  proposed  project  would  result  in  a  net  increase  of  64  AM  peak  hour  trips  (28  inbound,  36 
outbound),  68  PM  peak  hour  trips  (41  inbound,  27  outbound).   During  the  midday  peak  period,  the 
proposed  project  would  generate  approximately  76  peak  hour  trips  (37  inbound,  39  outbound)  and 
92  peak  hour  trips  (47  inbound,  45  outbound)  during  a  weekday  and  weekend  respectively.    On  a 
typical weekday, the proposed project would generate approximately 982 new daily trips.   

Each  of  ten  study  intersections  currently  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service  (LOS  D  or  better) 
during  each  of  the  four  peak  periods  analyzed.   The  addition  of  trips  related  to  planned  or  approved, 
but  yet  to  be  occupied  projects  in  the  area  are  anticipated  to  result  in  minimal  increases  in  average 
delay,  and  each  of  the  study  intersections  are  anticipated  to  operate at the same LOS for each of the 
four analysis periods.   

The  addition  of  project  related  traffic  would  result  in  additional  minimal  increases  in  average  delay.  
However  each  of  the  study  intersections  would  continue  to  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service.  
Therefore, no significant project impacts are anticipated at the study intersections. 

The  proposed  project  would  provide  approximately  153  parking  spaces.   Based  on  City  of  San  Bruno 
Municipal  Code  requirements,  the  project  is  required  to  provide  152  parking  spaces.  Therefore  the 
project would meet the City's parking requirement. 

Counts  and  observations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  site  show  that  pedestrian  and  bicycle  activity  is 
common, and pedestrians occasionally make illegal crossings.  Traffic collision history also shows that 
approximately  66  collisions  have  occurred  over  the  last  two  years,  and  approximately  four  of  them 
involved pedestrians. 

There  are  currently  five  SamTrans  bus  routes  that  operate  within  reasonable  walking  distance  of  the 
proposed  project.   Rail  service  is available via BART or Caltrain.  The San Bruno Caltrain station is less 
than  a  halfmile  away  while  the  San  Bruno  BART  station  is  approximately  one  mile  north.  Due to the 
available  capacity  on  the  nearby  local  buses,  and  the  anticipated  minimal  generation  of  new  transit 
trips, transit operations would not be adversely impacted.  

Cumulative  growth  by  the  year  2030  is  anticipated  to  result  in  substantial  traffic  increases  at  the 
study  intersections.    Several  of  the  study  intersections  would  deteriorate  to  a  deficient  LOS  E  or  F 
based  on  the  projected  growth.   The  addition  of  project  related  traffic  at  these  intersections  would 
result in minimal increases in average delay (less than two seconds).  Therefore, the proposed project 
is not anticipated to significantly contribute to the cumulative deficiencies.

Based  on  the  analysis  conducted  for  this  report  and  significance  criteria  for  both  the  City  of  San 
Bruno and the C/CAG, no significant transportation impacts associated with the proposed project are 
anticipated.

1.0   INTRODUCTION 
This  study  provides  an  evaluation  of  traffic  and  transportation  issues  related  to  the  proposed  mixed
use  development  consisting  of  fortytwo  condominiums  and  15,800  square  feet  of  retail  space  in  the 
City  of  San  Bruno.   Particular  attention  is  given  to  impacts  on  vehicular  traffic  at  local  intersections, 
transit, pedestrian, and bicycle operations, and site access and circulation. 

The  existing  buildings  at  400418  San  Mateo  Avenue  are  currently  vacant  with  the  exception  of  one 
dental office within the former cinema building. 

1.1      Study Methodology 
The  project  site  is  located  on  the  south  side  of  San  Mateo  Avenue  between  El  Camino  Real,  Mastick 
Avenue, and Taylor Avenue.   

Access to the proposed project will be from a driveway along Mastick Avenue.  Based on consultation 
with  City  of  San  Bruno  staff,  the  following  intersections  were  analyzed  as  part  of  the  City  of  San 
Bruno traffic impact analysis: 
              1.    San Mateo Avenue/El Camino Real/Taylor Avenue 
              2.    Mastick Avenue/Taylor Avenue 
              3.    Crystal Springs Road/El Camino Real 
              4.    Crystal Springs Road/Cunningham Road (I280 Access) 
              5.    San Bruno Avenue/San Mateo Avenue 
              6.    San Bruno Avenue/US 101 SB Ramps 
              7.    San Bruno Avenue/US 101 NB Ramps 
              8.    San Bruno Avenue/El Camino Real

              10.   I380 WB OffRamp/El Camino Real 
The project location, the surrounding roadway network, and the existing lane geometries at the study 
intersections  are  illustrated  in  Figure  1.   Operations  of  these  intersections  were  analyzed  during  the 
weekday  AM  (7:00  AM  ­  9:00  AM)  and  PM  (4:00  PM  ­  6:00  PM)  peak  periods  as  well  as  weekday 
midday  (11:30  AM  ­  1:30  PM)  and  weekend  midday  (12:00  PM  ­  2:00  PM)  and  evaluated  for  the 
following scenarios: 

        Scenario 1:         Existing  Conditions  ­  Level  of  Service  based  on  existing  peakhour  and 
                            midday volumes. 

        Scenario 2:         Background  Conditions  ­  Existing  peakhour  and  midday  volumes  plus 
                            growth from approved developments in the vicinity of the proposed project.

1.2         Data Collection 

Turning  movement  counts  were  collected  for  the  ten  study  intersections  during  a  typical  weekday 
AM and PM peak period, as well as weekday midday and weekend midday time periods in September 
2007.  In addition, pedestrian and bicycle counts were also taken at the intersection of El Camino Real 
/ San Mateo Avenue / Taylor Avenue.  Turning movement counts are provided in Appendix A. 

1.3         Intersection Level of Service Methodology 
To  evaluate  the  existing  traffic  conditions,  as  well  as  provide  a  basis  for  comparison  of  conditions 
before  and  after  projectgenerated  traffic  is  added  to  the  street  system,  the  intersection  Level  of 
Service (LOS) was evaluated at the identified study intersections.   

The  City  of  San  Bruno  requires  that  LOS  D  be  maintained.   Significant  traffic  impacts  at  intersections 
are  defined  to  occur  when  the  addition  of  net  new  project  traffic  causes  traffic  operating  conditions 
to  deteriorate  from  an  acceptable  level  of  service  to  an  unacceptable  level.   An  intersection  found  to 
operate at LOS E or F would constitute a significant impact.  Intersections which operate at LOS E or F 
in a base condition must maintain that level of service. 

In  the  City  of  San  Bruno,  the  intersection  of  El  Camino  Real  and  San  Bruno  Avenue  is  a  San  Mateo 
County  Congestion  Management  Program  (CMP)  intersection  with  a  standard  of  LOS  E1.   Significant 
traffic impacts at CMP intersections are defined to occur when the addition of net new project traffic 
causes  traffic  operating  conditions  to  violate  the  adopted  CMP  standard  (LOS  E  in  this  case).  
Cumulative  traffic  impacts  are  defined  to  occur  when  the  combination  of  project  and  future 
cumulative  traffic  demand  cause  the  intersection  to  violate  the  adopted  CMP  standard,  and  the 
project will increase average control delay at the intersection by 4 seconds or more2. 

The  analysis  was  performed  using  the  TRAFFIX  software  program.    TRAFFIX  is  the  designated 
intersection  Level  of  Service  analysis  software.   TRAFFIX  evaluates  signalized  intersection  operation 
on  the  basis  of  average  stopped  delay  for  all  vehicles  at  the  intersection.    The  analysis  uses 
procedures  from  the  2000  Transportation  Research  Board  Highway  Capacity  Manual  (HCM)  method 
for signalized intersections.  In addition, TRAFFIX evaluates unsignalized intersections on the basis of 
average  stopped  delay  for  allway  stopcontrolled  intersections,  and  for  the  worst  case  approach  for 
twoway  stop  controlled  intersections.  The  correlation  between  average  stopped  delay  and  level  of 
service for both signalized and unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 1.

2.1      Intersection Level of Service 
Turning  movement  counts  for  each  of  the  study  intersections  were  collected  in  September  2007  for 
each  of  the  peak  analysis  periods.    Intersection  geometry  and  timing  parameters  are  based  on 
information  collected  during  recent  field  observations.    For  the  study  intersections  in  this  analysis, 
the City of San Bruno has a level of service standard of LOS D. 

Figure 2 illustrates the existing weekday AM, midday, and PM peak hour turning movement counts at 
each of the ten study intersections.  Weekend midday turning movement counts are shown in Figure 
3.    The  existing  LOS  for  the  study  intersections  are  presented  in  Table  2.    According  to  the 
intersection  level  of  service  standards,  each  of  the  study  intersections  currently  operate  at  an 
acceptable LOS D or better during each of the scenarios analyzed.

2.2       Traffic Collision Analysis  
Traffic  collision  data  records,  spanning  approximately  a  two  year  period  from  January  2006  to 
October 2007, were provided by the City of San Bruno Police Department and analyzed as part of the 
existing  conditions.   The  collision  records  include  data  from  five  major  intersections  in  the  vicinity  of 
the project site:  
 
     · San Mateo Avenue / El Camino Real / Taylor Avenue 
     · Crystal Springs Road / El Camino Real 
     · El Camino Real / Jenevein Avenue 
     · El Camino Real / San Bruno Avenue 
     · El Camino Real / I380 
 
As  shown  in  Table  3,  during  the  two  year  analysis  period,  there  were  a  total  of  66  reported  traffic 
collisions  at  the  five  selected  intersections.    Approximately  39  percent  of  these  occurred  at  the 
intersection  of  El  Camino  Real  and  San  Bruno  Avenue,  a  high  volume,  eightphase  intersection  with 
multiple  leftturn  lanes.    Of  the  66  reported  traffic  collisions,  four  involved  a  pedestrian.    Two  of 
these occurred at the intersection of San Mateo Avenue, El Camino Real, and Taylor Avenue.

2.3      Pedestrian and Bicycle Operations 
Pedestrian Operations 

Due  to  the  project  site  being  located  in  the  Central  Business  District  of  San  Bruno,  pedestrian 
sidewalks  are  present  on  all  streets  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  site.    A  pedestrian  push  button 
activated crosswalk is in place at the San Mateo Avenue / El Camino Real / Taylor Avenue intersection 
on  the  south  leg  (crossing  El  Camino  Real)  and  the  west  leg  (crossing  Taylor  Avenue).   Five  marked 
crosswalks are in place along San Mateo Avenue between El Camino Real and Jenevein Avenue. 

Weekday peak hour, midday, and Saturday midday pedestrian counts were taken for the intersection 
of  San  Mateo  Avenue  /  El  Camino  Real  /  Taylor  Avenue.    As  shown  in  Figure  4,  the  PM  peak  hour 
(4:00  PM  to  5:00  PM  for  pedestrians)  has  the  highest  weekday  pedestrian  volume.    The  weekend 
midday  peak  hour  (12:00  PM  to  1:00  PM),  however,  has  the  highest  overall  pedestrian  volumes.  
During  each  of  the  four  survey  time  periods,  at  least  one  pedestrian  was  observed  to  cross the north 
leg of El Camino Real where pedestrian crossings are prohibited. 

Bicycle Operations 

Bicycle facilities in San Bruno consist of routes that share roadways with motorized vehicles (Class III), 
which  are  signed  as  bicycle  routes,  but  do  not  have  bicycle  lane  markings  on  the  pavement.  
According  to  the  2000  San  Mateo  County  Comprehensive  Bicycle  Route  Plan,  the  primary  bicycle 
routes  in  San  Bruno  include  Sneath  Lane,  San  Mateo  Avenue,  and  Crystal  Springs  Avenue.   There  are 
no  Class  I  or  Class  II  bicycle  facilities  within  San  Bruno.    Class  I  bicycle  facilities  are  completely 
separated  from  motor  vehicle  traffic,  such  as  an  offstreet  pathway.   Class  II  bicycle  facilities,  or  bike 
lanes, are portions of the roadway that are marked with a line for use by bicyclists. 

Weekday  peak  hour,  midday,  and  Saturday  midday  bicycle  counts  were  taken  for  the  intersection  of 
San  Mateo  Avenue  /  El  Camino  Real  /  Taylor  Avenue.   As  shown  in  Figure  5,  the  AM  peak  hour  (7:00 
AM  to  8:00  AM  for  bicyclists)  has  the  highest  overall  bicycle  volume  among  the  four  surveyed  time

3.0  BACKGROUND CONDITIONS 
Per City of San Bruno staff, there are five approved or planned projects in the vicinity of the proposed 
project  that  are  anticipated  to  add  traffic  to  the  study.    Traffic  related  to  the  following  five 
developments were included as part of the Background Conditions scenario: 
 
    · Glenview  Terraces  ­  16  attached  residential  units,  located  on  the  north  side  of  San  Bruno 
         Avenue near Skyline Drive.  
    · Skycrest  Project  ­  27  single  family  residential  units  to  replace  23,500  square  feet  of 
         commercial use, located south of San Bruno Avenue near Skyline Boulevard. 
    · The  Crossings  Parcels  3  &  4  ­  350  residential  units,  of  which  187  will  be  condominium  units 
         and 163 will be apartment units, located at El Camino Real north of I380. 
    · 599  Cedar  Avenue  (Cedar  Grove)  ­  14  town  homes  with  a  new  private  access  road,  located 
         on Cedar Avenue between San Bruno Avenue and Jenevein Avenue. 
    · Tanforan  Cinema  ­  20screen  movie  theatre  megaplex  expansion  at  the  Tanforan  Mall, 
         located at El Camino Real, north of I380. 
     
Figure 7 shows the location of each Background Condition project on the study area map.  Additional 
information related to the five Background Condition projects is provided in Appendix C. 


3.1      Background Trip Generation, Distribution and Assignment 
The  trip  generation,  distribution,  and  assignment  numbers  for  each  of  the  background  projects  were 
taken  from  their  respective  traffic  studies,  as  available.    Where  this  information  was  not  available, 
the  Institute  of  Transportation  Engineers  Trip  Generation  Manual,  7th  Edition  (2004),  was  used  to 
estimate  trip  generation.    Trip  distribution  and  trip  assignment  was  based  on  prevailing  traffic 
patterns  and  a  screenline  analysis  around  the  study  area.   Table  4  summarizes  the  data  sources  for 
the  background  condition  projects.    Figure  7  illustrates  the  locations  of  the  planned  and  approved 
projects in the study area. 

For  many  of  the  background  condition  projects,  a  weekday  midday  or  weekend  midday  analysis 
scenario  was  not  included  in  the  cited  traffic  study.    For  these  scenarios,  the  ITE  Trip  Generation 
Manual was used for trip generation, and trip distribution and trip assignment was based on the peak 
hour distribution and assignment. 

The  Glenview  Terraces  and  Skycrest  Project  contributed  fewer  than  3  trips  to  the  study  intersections 
during  the  weekday  peak  hour.    Therefore,  it  was  assumed  that  they  would  add  an  insignificant 
amount of trips during weekday and weekend midday periods.   

The  Cedar  Grove  project  and  the  Tanforan  Cinema  project  were  assumed  to  add  an  insignificant 
amount of trips to the study intersections during the weekday AM peak and weekday midday periods 
due to the nature of the anticipated land uses.

  3.2          Intersection Operations­ Background Conditions 
  The  Background  levels  of  service  for  the  study  intersections  are  presented  in  Table  5.  According  to 
  the intersection level of service standards for both the City of San Bruno and the C/CAG of San Mateo 
  County,  the  study  intersections  would  continue  to  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service.   Although 
  average  delays  at  some  of  the  study  intersections  would  increase  slightly,  the  LOS  at  each  of  the 
  study  intersections  would  not  change.    The  study  intersections  are  not  anticipated  to  operate  at 
  deficient levels under the Background Conditions scenario. 
  Table  5  summarizes  the  intersection  operating  conditions  for  the  Background  Scenario.   Background 
  Conditions intersection operating calculations are provided in Appendix B.

4.0  PROJECT CONDITIONS 
This  scenario  evaluates  the  background  traffic  conditions  with  the  addition  of  netnew  traffic 
estimated  from  the  proposed  project.   The  amount  of  traffic  associated  with  a  project  is  estimated 
using  a  threestep  process:  (1)  trip  generation,  (2)  trip  distribution,  and  (3)  trip  assignment.    Trip 
generation is the process of predicting the number of peak hour trips a proposed development would 
contribute  to  the  roadways,  and  whether  these  trips  would  be  entering  or  exiting  the  site.   After  the 
number  of  trips  is  determined,  the  distribution  process  projects  the  direction  these  trips  use  to 
approach  and  depart  the  site  from  a  regional  perspective.    Trip  assignment  involves  determining 
which specific roadways a vehicle would use to travel between its origin and destination. 
 
Significance Criteria and Project Impacts 
 
The  significance  criteria  for  this  analysis  follow  the  guidelines  adopted  by  the  City  of  San  Bruno.   A 
significant impact for a project is defined as: 
         ·  When  the  addition  of  the  project  traffic  causes  an  intersection  LOS  under  the  base 
            condition to deteriorate from acceptable level of service D or better to LOS E or LOS F, or 
         ·  Intersections  which  already  operate  at  unacceptable  LOS  E  or  F  must  maintain  that  LOS 
            with the addition of netnew project traffic 
For the intersection of El Camino Real and San Bruno Avenue, a San Mateo County CMP intersection, 
a significant impact for a project is defined as: 
         ·  When  the  addition  of  the  project  traffic  causes  an  intersection  LOS  under  the  base 
            condition to deteriorate from acceptable level of service E or better to LOS F, or 
         ·  The  combination  of  cumulative  traffic  demand  and  net  new  project  traffic  causes  an 
            intersection  LOS  under  to  deteriorate  from  acceptable  level  of  service  E  or  better  to  LOS 
            F and the net new project traffic will increase average control delay at the intersection by 
            4 seconds or more 

4.1      Project Trip Generation 
Estimated  trip  generation  of  trips  for  the  proposed  project  was  based  on  rates  obtained  from  the 
Institute  of  Transportation  Engineers  Trip  Generation  Manual,  7th  Edition,  2003  for  the  AM  and  PM 
peak  hours.   As  a  conservative  estimate,  vehicle  trip  credits  were  not  applied  to  the  estimated  trip 
generation for the partially occupied cinema building, and vacant commercial land uses. 

Table  6  indicates  that  the  proposed  project  would  result  in  a  net  increase  of  64  vehicle  trips  (28 
inbound,  36  outbound)  during  the  AM  peak  hour,  68  vehicle  trips  (41  inbound,  27  outbound)  during 
the PM peak hour, 76 vehicle trips (37 inbound, 39 outbound) during the weekday midday peak hour, 
and  92  vehicle  trips  (47  inbound,  45  outbound)  during  the  weekend  midday peak hour.  There would 
also be a net increase in total daily traffic of approximately 982 vehicle trips.

4.2      Trip Distribution and Trip Assignment 
The  proposed  distribution  patterns  used  for  this  analysis  are  based  on  the  prevailing  traffic  patterns 
around  the  study  area.   Based  on  the  peak  hour  traffic  volumes,  a  screenline  analysis  was  conducted 
to  estimate  vehicular  trip  patterns.    Existing  turning  movement  counts  at  the  study  gateway 
intersections  were  analyzed  for  traffic  to  and  from  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  project.   An  estimate 
of  total  existing  volumes  from  El  Camino  Real  (north  and  south),  San  Mateo  Avenue,  US  101  (north 
and  south)  via  San  Bruno  Avenue,  I280  (north  and  south)  via  Crystal  Springs  Road  and  San  Bruno 
Avenue, and I380 (east and west) via El Camino Real were assumed to be the origin or destination of 
project related trips.  In general, approximately 30 percent of the trips go to and from El Camino Real 
north,  25  percent  go  to  and  from  El  Camino  Real  south,  seven  percent  travel  on  I380  west,  15 
percent  use  US  101  north,  12  percent  use  US  101  south,  five  percent  travel  on  San  Bruno  Avenue 
west,  four  percent  travel  on  Crystal  Springs  Road  west,  and  two  percent  use  San  Mateo  Avenue 
north.   Figure  10  illustrates  the  trip  distribution  patterns  for  the  proposed  project  and  the  net  new 
project  trips  at  each  of  the  analysis  intersections.    Figure  11  and  Figure  12  illustrate  the  Project 
Conditions  peak  hour  traffic  volumes  for  a  weekday  and  weekend  respectively.   Table  6  summarizes 
the intersection operating conditions for the Background Scenario. 
 

4.3      Intersection Operations­ Project Conditions 
The  project  levels  of  service  for  the  study  intersections  are  presented  in  Table  7.  According  to  the 
intersection  level  of  service  standards  for  both  the  City  of  San  Bruno  and  the  C/CAG  of  San  Mateo 
County,  the  study  intersections  that  would  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service  under  the 
Background  Conditions  would  continue  to  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service  under  the  project 
condition for both the AM and PM peak periods as well as the weekday midday and weekend midday 
peak periods.  The study intersections are not anticipated to experience any significant impacts.

  During  each  of  the  analysis  peak  hours,  the  addition  of  traffic  due  to  the  proposed  project  would 
  result  in  minimal  increases  in  average  delay  at  the  study  intersections.    During  weekday  AM  and 
  Midday  peak  hours,  the  operating  LOS  would  remain  the  same  at  each  of  the  study  intersections.  
  During  the  weekday  PM  peak  hour  and  weekend  midday  peak  hour,  the  intersection  of  Mastick 
  Avenue  and  Taylor  Avenue  would  decrease  from  LOS  B  to  LOS  C;  however  this  is  still  considered  an 
  acceptable  level  of  service.    Each  of  the  ten  study  intersections  would  continue  to  operate  at 
  acceptable  levels  of  service  during  each  of  the  of  the  study  periods.   No  significant  project  impacts 
  are anticipated at the study intersections.

4.3          Project Site Plan, Parking and Circulation Analysis 
Project Site Circulation 

The project site is located on the corner of Mastic Avenue, Taylor Avenue, and San Mateo Avenue (At 
El Camino Real).  The proposed site plan is illustrated in Figure 13.  Based on the current site plan, the 
access  driveway  to  the  garage  is  located  on  Mastic  Avenue  and  the  driveway  is  estimated  to  be  19 
                                                               3
feet  wide.   Per  the  City  of  San  Bruno's  Municipal  Code    "The  minimum  width  for  singlefamily  and 
multiple family residential driveways shall be twelve feet for single driveways and twentyfour feet for 
double  driveways,  measured  at  the  face  of  the  curb".   Therefore  the  project  driveway  access  would 
not satisfy the City's Code in this regard. 

OffStreet Parking 

The City of San Bruno Municipal Code requires that residential, multidwelling units with one or more 
bedrooms  have  at  least  two  covered  parking  spaces  per  unit  plus  0.1  spaces  per  unit  for  guest 
parking.   For  general  retail  uses,  the  parking  requirement  is  one  space  for  every  250  square  feet  of 
                  4
gross floor area .  With 48 dwelling units and 15,800 square feet of retail space, the proposed project 
would  require  165  parking  spaces.   Six  of  the  dwelling  units,  however,  would  be  built  as  "affordable 
units"  and  would  be  exempt  from  the  parking  requirements.    This  lowers  the  number  of  required 
parking spaces to 152.

    Based  on  the  Institute  of  Transportation  Engineers  (ITE)  Parking  Generation  Manual,  3rd  Edition, 
    2004, the estimated average peak parking demand for residential condominiums/townhouses is 1.46 
    spaces  per  unit.    For  a  shopping  center  (general  or  specialty  retail  uses  were  not  included  in  the 
    Manual),  the  Friday,  NonDecember  average  peak  period  parking  demand  is  3.02  spaces  per  1,000 
    square  feet  of  gross  leasable  area.    Transit  service  to  a  shopping  center,  however,  was  shown  to 
    reduce  peak  parking  demand  by  up  to  eight  percent,  based  on  limited  data.    Since  the  proposed 
    project  is  in  a  downtown  setting  that  includes  a  pedestrian  and  transit  oriented  environment,  the 
    eight  percent  reduction  in  estimated  peak  parking  demand  could  be  applied.   This  would  result  in  a 
    total demand of approximately 114 parking spaces. 

    The  proposed  condominium  and  retail  development  would  have  104  basement  parking  spaces  and 
    49  ground  level  parking  spaces.   The  proposed  offstreet  parking  supply  of  153  parking  spaces  would 
    meet  the  City  of  San  Bruno  parking  requirements  and  would  be  at  97  percent  of  the  estimated  ITE 
    parking  demand.   No  significant  parking  impacts  are  anticipated.   Table  8  summarizes  the  offstreet 
    parking conditions

    Notes:     1.  Only  42  units  count  towards  City  of  San  Bruno  Municipal  Code  since  six*1.08  units  qualify  as  "affordable  units"  and  are 
               exempt from the parking requirement.  All 48, however, are included in the estimated parking demand. 
               2. The estimated parking demand for the retail land use includes an eight percent reduction due to transit access. 

     

    OnStreet Parking 

    Onstreet  parking  in  the vicinity of the project is very limited.  Eight parallel parking spaces which are 
    free  but  limited  to  one  hour  are  provided  off  of  San  Mateo  Avenue  directly  adjacent  to  the  project 
    site.    These  spaces  are  typically  used  by  downtown  visitors  coming  from  outside  of  the  immediate 
    area.    On  Mastick  Avenue,  there  are  approximately  eight  parallel  parking  spaces,  also  free,  located 
    behind  the  project  site  on  the  far  side  (east  side)  of  the  street.   These  spaces  are  most  likely  utilized 
    by the adjacent residential uses or downtown visitors.  Onstreet parking is also available, for free, on 
    Mastick Avenue south of Taylor Avenue, and Taylor Avenue east of Mastick Avenue. 

    Most  residents  and  visitors  to  the  project  site  are  anticipated  to  use  the  provided  offstreet  parking 
    spaces.

4.4      Transit Operations 
Residential uses within the City of San Bruno typically have a transit mode share of approximately six 
percent  for  bus  trips  (San  Bruno  2025:  General  Plan  Environmental  Impact  Report,  October  2003).  
Trips  related  to  BART  or  Caltrain  were  not  estimated  as  it  is  likely  that  trips  destined  to  BART  or 
Caltrain  will  utilize  a  vehicle  trip  to  access  the  stations.   A  mode  share  of  six  percent  would  result  in 
less than five peak hour transit trips.  The current bus operations would be anticipated to easily serve 
the  estimated  transit  demands,  without  affecting  the  load  factors  on  bus  lines  or  BART.    Thus,  no 
adverse transit impacts are anticipated. 

4.5      Pedestrian and Bicycle Analysis 
Pedestrian Access and Circulation 

The  proposed  project  would  typically  have  a  six  to  eight  foot  sidewalk  along  the  property  frontages 
on  San  Mateo  Avenue,  Taylor  Avenue,  and  Mastick  Avenue.    The  proposed  sidewalks  would  be 
consistent  with  adjacent  areas,  and  provide  adequate  pedestrian  circulation  facilities.    For 
developments  of  this  size  and  setting,  a  mode  split  of  pedestrian  specific  trips  during  the  peak 
periods is anticipated to be less than ten percent, which would result in less than ten pedestrian trips 
per hour.   

Bicycle Mode Share and Circulation 

Estimation  of  a  mode  share  related  to  bicycle  use  is  typically  reserved  for  employment  type 
developments.   For  residential  developments  of  this  size  and  setting,  a  mode  split  of  bicycle  specific 
trips  during  the  AM  and  PM  peak  periods  is  anticipated  to  be  negligible.   The  total  number  of  peak 
hour  bicycle  trips  would  be  minimal,  and  would  not  exceed  the  available  capacity  on  the  pedestrian 
and  bicycle  facilities.   Based  on  a  review  of  the  proposed  site  plan,  the  proposed  project  would  not 
create  any  features  which  would  be  unsafe  or  hinder  pedestrian  or  bicycle  travel.    Therefore,  the 
proposed project is not anticipated to result in any potentially significant bicycle impacts. 

4.6      Regional Roadways 
There  are  four  state  highways  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  site;  State  Route  82  (El  Camino  Real),  U.S. 
Route  101,  I280,  and  I380.   Because  the  proposed  project  is  anticipated  to  generate  less  than  100 
netnew  peak  hour  trips,  a  formal  analysis  of  the  routes  of  regional  significance  is  not  required.  
Therefore, the following is provided for informational purposes only.   
Based  on  the  estimated  trip  generation  and  trip  distribution  patterns,  each  of  the  regional  roadways 
would  experience  a  slight  increase  in  traffic  from  the  proposed  project  when  compared  to  the 
existing  conditions.    In  general,  the  number  of  trips  added  to  El  Camino  Real  would  be  less  than  25 
vehicles  per  direction  of  travel  to  the  north,  and  less  than  12  to  the  South.   On  U.S.  101,  I280,  or  I
380,  less  than  eight  vehicles  per  hour  are  anticipated  in  any  direction  of  travel.   No  adverse  impacts 
to the regional roadways are anticipated.

5.0  CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS 
The  Cumulative  and  Cumulative  plus  Project  scenarios  are  based  on  anticipated  growth  in  the  long 
range  forecast.    This  scenario  represents  year  2030  conditions,  and  is  based  on  the  County  of  San 
Mateo's C/CAG travel demand model.     

5.1      Planned Roadway Improvements 
Planned roadway improvements are typically included in the analysis of future long range conditions.  
However,  for  the  study  intersections,  there  are  no  planned  improvements.   Therefore,  the  analysis 
for the Cumulative Conditions assumes that the roadway network and intersection geometries would 
remain the same. 

5.2      Traffic Volumes and Intersection Levels of Service 
For  the  Cumulative  Conditions  scenario,  specific  link  traffic  volume  estimates  from  the  Countywide 
traffic model were provided by City of San Bruno Staff for the years 2030 and 2005.  The intersection 
traffic volumes for the long range forecast are based on annual growth estimated using the 2005 and 
2030 travel demand models.  The growth rates were applied to the existing traffic counts for 23 years 
to  estimate  year  2030  conditions.    Trips  related  to  planned  and  approved  projects  (Background 
Conditions) were assumed to be included in the year 2030 traffic model.    

Using  the  travel  demand  models,  an  annual  growth  rate  of  2.8  percent  and  2.5  percent  were 
estimated  for  the  AM  and  PM  peak  periods  respectively.   The  growth  rates  were  applied  to  the  2007 
traffic  count  data  for  23  years  to  estimate  2030  conditions.   For  the  weekday  and  weekend  midday 
periods,  travel  demand  forecasts  are  not  available,  therefore  an  average  of  the  AM  and  PM  peak 
period  growth  rates  was  applied  (2.66  percent).   Figure  14  and  Figure  15  illustrates  the  Cumulative 
No Project Conditions peak hour traffic volumes for a typical weekday and weekend respectively. 

Based  on  the  estimated  traffic  volumes,  and  using  analysis  methodology  similar  to  the  previously 
analyzed  scenarios,  operating  conditions  for  the  year  2030  conditions  were  estimated.    Of  the  ten 
study  intersections,  nine  would  operate  at  LOS  D  or  better  during  the  AM  peak  hour,  and  five  would 
operate  at  LOS  D  or  better  during  the  PM  peak  hour.   Intersections  that  are  projected  to  operate  at 
LOS E or F were considered to be cumulatively deficient. 

During  the  weekday  midday  period, all ten study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS D 
or  better.   During  the  weekend  midday  period,  nine  of  the  ten  study  intersections  would  operate  at 
an  acceptable  LOS  D  or  better.      Table  9  summarizes  the  intersection  operating  conditions  for  the 
Cumulative (No Project) Conditions. 

The  estimated  traffic  volumes  based  on  the  travel  demand  models  represent  an  aggressive  growth 
pattern for the area.  With a substantial increase in traffic, several intersections would deteriorate to 
deficient levels during three of the four analysis periods for the Cumulative No Project scenario.

  During  the  AM  peak  hour,  the  intersection  of  Crystal  Springs  Road  and  Cunningham  Road  would 
  deteriorate  to  a  deficient  LOS  F.   During  the  PM  peak  hour,  five  of  the  ten  study  intersections  would 
  deteriorate  to  a  deficient  LOS  E  or  F.    All  ten  study  intersections  are  anticipated  to  operate  at 
  acceptable levels during the weekday midday period. 

  During  the  Weekend  midday  peak,  the  intersection  of  San  Bruno  Avenue  and  El  Camino  Real  is 
  anticipated  to  deteriorate  to  LOS  E,  and  the  intersection  of  the  I380  Westbound  OffRamp  at  El 
  Camino Real is anticipated to operate at a deficient LOS F.

6.0  CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS 
This  section  evaluates  cumulative  traffic  conditions  plus  projectgenerated  traffic  estimated  for  the 
proposed  project.    New  traffic  associated  with  the  proposed  project  was  described  previously  in 
Section  4.0,  and  the  project  related  trips  were  added  to  the  study  intersections  using  consistent  trip 
generation and distribution patterns.   

6.1      Significance Criteria and Project Impacts 
The  significance  criteria  used  for  the  Cumulative  plus  Project  scenario  are  the  same  as  those 
previously  described  in  Section  5.0.   Potentially  significant  project  related  cumulative  impacts  were 
determined  based  on  the  changes  in  traffic  operating  conditions  in  comparisons  to  the  Cumulative 
(without project) conditions.  

Trip  generation,  trip  distribution,  and  trip  assignment  methodology  assumptions  were  assumed  to 
remain consistent with the methodologies described in Section 4. 

The  project  trips  were  added  to  each  of  the  study  intersections  for  the  weekday  AM  and  PM  peak 
hours  and  the  weekday  and  weekend  midday  peak  periods.    Figure  16  and  17  illustrates  the 
Cumulative  plus  Project  scenario  traffic  volumes  at  each  of  the  study  intersections  for  each  of  the 
analysis periods during a weekday and weekend respectively. 

6.2      Cumulative plus Project Intersection Operation  
In comparison to the Cumulative No Project scenario, all of the study intersections would continue to 
operate  at  the  same  levels  of  service  with  the  addition  of  project  related  trips.   At  intersections  that 
are estimated to operate at deficient LOS E or F, the addition of project related traffic would result in 
average  delay  increases  of  less  than  two  seconds.   Therefore,  the  proposed  project  would  not  result 
in  any  significant  cumulative  impacts,  nor  significantly  contribute  to  anticipated  cumulative 
deficiencies.    Table  10  provides  a  summary  of  the  Cumulative  plus  Project  scenario  intersection 
service levels for each of the peak hours analyzed.   

The  proposed  project  would  not  result  in  any  potentially  significant  cumulative  impacts  at  the  study 
intersections.

7.0  CONCLUSION 
The proposed mixed use development site is located at 400418 San Mateo Avenue in the City of San 
Bruno,  California.   The  proposed  project  consists  of  fortytwo  condominium  units  and  15,800  square 
feet  of  retail  space.    The  project  site  is  currently  occupied  by  a  dental  office  at  the  former  cinema 
building and various other vacant commercial uses. 

The  proposed  project  would  result  in  a  net  increase  of  64  AM  peak  hour  trips  (28  inbound,  36 
outbound),  68  PM  peak  hour  trips  (41  inbound,  27  outbound).   During  the  midday  peak  period,  the 
proposed  project  would  generate  approximately  76  peak  hour  trips  (37  inbound,  39  outbound)  and 
92  peak  hour  trips  (47  inbound,  45  outbound)  during  a  weekday  and  weekend  respectively.    On  a 
typical weekday, the proposed project would generate approximately 982 new daily trips.   

Each  of  ten  study  intersections  currently  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service  (LOS  D  or  better) 
during  each  of  the  four  peak  periods  analyzed  and  are  anticipated  to  continue  to  operate  at 
acceptable  levels  under  the  Background  Conditions.    The  addition  of  project  related  traffic  would 
result  on  additional  minimal  increases  in  average  delay.    However  each  of  the  study  intersections 
would  continue  to  operate  at  acceptable  levels  of  service.   Therefore,  no  significant  project  impacts 
are anticipated at the study intersections. 

The  proposed  project  would  provide  approximately  153  parking  spaces,  and  would  meet  the  City's 
Municipal  Parking  Code  requirements.   Based  on  the  amount  of  estimated  traffic  generated  by  the 
proposed project, minimal amounts of pedestrian, bicycle and transit trips are anticipated.  

Cumulative growth by the year 2030 is anticipated to result in several deficiently operating conditions 
(LOS  E  or  F)  based  on  the  projected  growth.    The  addition  of  project  related  traffic  at  these 
intersections  would  result  in  minimal  increases  in  average  delay  (less  than  four  seconds.   Therefore, 
the proposed project is not anticipated to significantly contribute to the cumulative deficiencies. 

Based  on  the  analysis  conducted  for  this  report  and  significance  criteria  for  both  the  City  of  San 
Bruno and the C/CAG, no significant transportation impacts associated with the proposed project are 
anticipated.

                Comments on the draft traffic impact analysis report for the San Bruno Cinema 
                Redevelopment project were received from Mark Sullivan, Housing & Redevelopment 
                Manager at the City of San Bruno.  This memorandum summarizes these comments and 
                the responses. 
                 
                Response to Comments (Draft Report, dated February 5, 2008): 
                 
                1. Comment:    Executive  Summary:    Project  consists  of  48  condominium  units  and 
                   approximately  16,000  square  feet  of  retail.    Text  incorrectly  cites  42  units  and 
                   15,800 square feet of retail space. 
                    
                   Response:    First  paragraph  of  the  Executive  Summary  has  been  changed  to  reflect

      This  study  provides  an  evaluation  of  traffic  and  transportation  issues  related  to  the 
      proposed  mixeduse  development  consisting  of  fortytwo  eight  condominiums  and 
      15,800  approximately  16,000  square  feet  of  retail  space  in  the  City  of  San  Bruno.  
      Particular  attention  is  given  to  impacts  on  vehicular  traffic  at  local  intersections, 
      transit, pedestrian, and bicycle operations, and site access and circulation. 
       
   3. Comment:    Existing  Conditions:    The  dental  office  will  be  vacating  soon,  and  the 
      electronics retail store is already gone. 
       
      Response:   Description  of  project  site  has  been  changed  in  the  Executive  Summary, 
      Existing Conditions, and Conclusion:  
       
      The  existing  building  at  400418  El  Camino  Real  is  currently  occupied  by  a  dental 
      office  at  550  Taylor  Avenue,  an  electronics  retail  store  at  412  El  Camino  Real,  and  a 
      lounge/bar  at  418  El  Camino  Real.   The  project  site  is  located  on  the  east  side  of  El 
      Camino Real between San Mateo Avenue, Taylor Avenue, and Mastick Avenue. 
       
   4. Comment:    Background  conditions  and  Figure  7  should  include  the  Merimont 
      (2396 Evergreen Drive) development. 
       
      Response:    Merimont  project  has  been  added  to  the  list  of  background  projects.  
      However,  upon  further  analysis,  the  trip  generation  and  distribution  of  the 
      development  is  such  that  there  would  be  an  insignificant  number  of  trips  passing 
      through  any  study  intersection  during  the  AM  and  PM  peak hours.   This  is  described 
      in the text under section 3.1:  
       
      The  Merimont  by  SummerHill  Homes  development  is  projected  to  result  in  a  net 
      decrease  of  trips.   Only  four  percent  of  these  trips,  or  about  3  trips,  would  no  longer 
      travel  Sneath  Lane  and  potentially  through  a  study  intersection  on  El  Camino  Real 
      during  the  peak  hours.    This  was  considered  insignificant  due  to  the  dispersion  of 
      trips.    In  addition,  the  Merimont  Traffic  Impact  Analysis  discusses  the  possibility  of 
      the  Hoover  Children's  Daycare  Center  becoming  reoccupied.    Only  four  percent  of 
      these  trips,  or  about  4  trips,  would  be  added  to  Sneath  Lane  during  the  peak  hours 
      and is considered insignificant to the study intersections under the same reasoning. 
       
      Figure  7  has  been  updated  to  show  the  location  of  the  Merimont  project  and  is 
      provided as an attachment to this memorandum. 
       
   5. Comment:   Section  4.3:   Rewrite  the  "offstreet  parking"  requirements  to  include 
      reference  to  the  State's  density  bonus  law.    Also  include  the  following  text: 
      "Parking  requirements  for  the  proposed  project  may  be  further  adjusted  based  on 
      the fact  that  the  existing  buildings are  nonconforming  structures for  which  the 
      number  of  parking  spaces  provided  is less  than  required  per  San  Bruno  Municipal

           Code  12.92.020.C. The  Municipal  Code  allows  such  nonconformity  to  continue 
           provided  that  the  physical  change,  enlargement,  extension  does  not  increase  the 
           nonconformity.  In  addition,  the  subject  site  is  located  within  a  downtown  parking 
           assessment  district  which  provides  for  the reduction  or  elimination  of  off
           street parking  requirements if  the  Planning Commission  finds  that  the  parking 
           needs  for  the  particular  structure  or  use  are  substantially  met  by  the  parking 
           spaces provided in the district (Section 12.100.120.B). " 
            
           Response:    Text  referencing  the  State's  density  bonus  law  has  been  included  in 
           section  4.3.    Language  referring  to  affordable  housing  has  been  revised.    State 
           density bonus law parking requirements are now included in Table 8: 
            
   OffStreet Parking 

   The City of San Bruno Municipal Code requires that residential, multidwelling units with 
   one or more bedrooms have at least two covered parking spaces per unit plus 0.1 spaces 
   per unit for guest parking.  For general retail uses, the parking requirement is one space 
   for every 250 square feet of gross floor area1.  With 48 dwelling units and 15,800 
   approximately 16,000 square feet of retail space, the proposed project would require 
   165 parking spaces.    Six of the dwelling units, however, would be built as "affordable 
   units" and would be exempt from the parking requirements.  This lowers the number of 
   required spaces to 152.  The project, however, qualifies for a density bonus under the 
   State of California Density Bonus Law2 due to the provision of affordable units.  Cities 
   and counties are required to grant "concessions or incentives" that reduce development 
   standards, depending on the percentage of affordable units provided.  In the case of this 
   project, new parking standards are applied and they are as follows: 

           ·    Zero to one bedroom ­ One onsite parking space 

           ·    Two to three bedrooms ­ two onsite parking spaces 

   These numbers are inclusive of guest parking and handicap parking.  The project, which 
   will include 22 threebedroom units, 18 twobedroom units, and 8 onebedroom units, 
   will require 152 total parking spaces (residential and retail) under the new parking 
   standards as summarized in Table 8. 
    
           Parking  requirements  for  the  proposed  project  may  be  further  adjusted  based  on 
           the fact  that  the  existing  buildings are  nonconforming  structures for  which  the 
           number  of  parking  spaces  provided  is less  than  required  per  San  Bruno  Municipal 
           Code  12.92.020.C. The  Municipal  Code  allows  such  nonconformity  to  continue 
           provided  that  the  physical  change,  enlargement,  extension  does  not  increase  the

                   nonconformity.  In  addition,  the  subject  site  is  located  within  a  downtown  parking 
                   assessment  district  which  provides  for  the reduction  or  elimination  of  off
                   street parking  requirements if  the  Planning Commission  finds  that  the  parking  needs 
                   for  the  particular  structure  or  use  are  substantially  met  by  the  parking  spaces 
                   provided in the district (Section 12.100.120.B).  
                    
               Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Parking Generation Manual, 3rd 
               Edition, 2004, the estimated average peak parking demand for residential 
               condominiums/townhouses is 1.46 spaces per unit.  For a shopping center (general or 
               specialty retail uses were not included in the Manual), the Friday, NonDecember 
               average peak period parking demand is 3.02 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross 
               leasable area.  Transit service to a shopping center, however, was shown to reduce peak 
               parking demand by up to eight percent, based on limited data.  Since the proposed 
               project is in a downtown setting that includes a pedestrian and transit oriented 
               environment, the eight percent reduction in estimated peak parking demand could be 
               applied.  This would result in a total demand of approximately 114 parking spaces (70 
               residential and 44 retail). 

               The proposed condominium and retail development would have 104 basement parking 
               spaces and 49 ground level parking spaces.  The proposed offstreet parking supply of 
               153 parking spaces would not meet the City of San Bruno parking requirements.  With 
               the State Density Bonus Law in effect, however, the project would meet the new parking 
               requirements of 152 spaces.  In addition, the project would provide more spaces than the 
               ITE estimated parking demand.  and would be at 97 percent of the estimated ITE parking 
               demand.  No significant parking impacts are anticipated.  Table 8 summarizes the off
               street parking conditions.

   6. Comment:  Table 8:  Clarify text above table to reference how 158 ITE spaces come 
      from  114  residential  demand  and  44  retail  demand.   Show  how  City  of  San  Bruno 
      would  require  2.1  spaces  times  48  units  and  discuss  how  state  density  bonus  law 
      affects this requirement. 
    
      Response:    The  ITE  estimated  parking  demand  has  been  changed  to  correct  a 
      mathematical  error  in  the  initial  analysis.    The  new  estimated  ITE  demand  is  114 
      spaces  and  is  reflected  in  the  text  and  Table  8.    A  comparison  between  the  City's 
      requirements  and  the  State's  as  well  as  ITE's  estimated  demand  is  shown  in  Table  8 
      as well. 
       
   7. Comment:  Off street parking:  Mention the City owned lot on Mastick (25 spaces). 
    
      Response:   Text  has  been  added  which  describes  the  location  and  availability  of  the 
      City owned lot below Table 8: 
       
      In  addition  to  the  153  onsite  parking  spaces  provided  by  the  project,  there  are  25 
      spaces  available  on  a  city  owned  lot  located  on  Mastick  Avenue,  adjacent  to  the 
      project site.  These spaces are free and are open to all downtown visitors. 
       
   8. Comment:   Conclusion,  first  paragraph:   Project  consists  of  48  condominium  units 
      and  approximately  16,000  square  feet  of  retail.   Text  incorrectly  cites  42  units  and 
      15,800 square feet of retail space. 
       
      Response:    First  paragraph  of  the  Conclusion  has  been  changed  to  reflect  the 
      description: 
       
      The proposed mixed use development site is located at 400418 San Mateo Avenue in 
      the  City  of  San  Bruno,  California.    The  proposed  project  consists  of  fortytwo  eight 
      condominium  units  and  15,800  approximately  16,000  square  feet  of  retail  space.  
      The project site is currently occupied by a dental office at the former cinema building

  INTERSECTION COUNTS
  Due to the extensive construction occurring in the area, no new counts undertaken for the PM
