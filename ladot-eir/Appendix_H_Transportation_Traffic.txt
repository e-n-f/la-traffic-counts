Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




1. INTRODUCTION

Fehr & Peers conducted a traffic study to evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the proposed baseball
fields, to be located either within the Crystal Springs Picnic Area in Griffith Park ("Crystal Springs Site") or
at the intersection of Chevy Chase Drive and Verdant Drive ("North Atwater Site"), located in Los Angeles,
California. This report identifies the base data and assumptions, explains the methodologies used, and
summarizes the findings of the study. The traffic impact analysis conducted for this report includes
analysis of existing (2013) conditions and opening year (2017) conditions.

Project Description

The proposed project would construct two youth baseball fields at one of two potential sites: within the
Crystal Springs Picnic Area in Griffith Park or on the east side of the Los Angeles River in North Atwater
Park. Each youth baseball field would include dugout seating for approximately 20 players on each team
and bleacher seating for approximately 90 spectators per field. The first Crystal Springs site configuration,
shown in Figure 1B, would displace approximately 56 picnic tables. The displaced picnic tables would be
relocated elsewhere in Griffith Park. The second potential configuration, shown in Figure 1B, would
displace approximately seven picnic tables. On the North Atwater Park site, shown in Figure 1C, the
project would replace an existing youth softball field and a basketball court. No programming
information is available at this time.

Study Scope

The scope of work for this study was developed in conjunction with the Los Angeles Department of
Transportation (LADOT). The base assumptions and technical methodologies were discussed as part of
the study approach. The study analyzes potential project-generated traffic impacts on the adjacent street
system for existing conditions and the opening year. The traffic scenarios listed below were analyzed for
the PM peak hour (between 3:00 and 6:00 PM) and Saturday mid-day peak hour (between 11:00 AM and
2:00 PM). Although there are two potential configurations for the Crystal Springs candidate site, one set
of intersection analyses has been conducted for this site, as the ultimate trip generation, distribution, and
assignment would be the same regardless of how the fields are configured at this site.

    ·    Existing (Year 2013) Conditions ­ The analysis of existing Year 2013 traffic conditions provides a
         basis for the remainder of the study. The existing conditions analysis includes an assessment of
         streets, traffic volumes, and operating conditions. The existing traffic conditions are the baseline for
         assessing the significance of project impacts.

    ·    Existing (Year 2013) plus Project Conditions ­ Crystal Springs Site ­ This is an analysis of existing

         project in the opening year 2017. The objective of this phase of analysis is to project future traffic
         growth and operating conditions that could be expected to result from regional ambient growth
         and known cumulative projects if the proposed project were not developed. The cumulative base
         traffic forecasts are used to develop cumulative baseline operating conditions that provide the basis
         for determining cumulative project impacts.

         developed for year 2017. The objective of this analysis is to develop the traffic forecasts of the
         proposed project that are then used to identify potential impacts.


The traffic study focuses on the weekday PM and Saturday mid-day peak hours of traffic because these
represent a combination of peak traffic conditions and the most intense activities of the baseball fields,
yielding the greatest potential for impact.

As illustrated in Figure 2, six intersections were identified, in consultation with LADOT, for weekday
evening and Saturday mid-day peak hour analysis as part of the scope of work for this project. Study
intersections 1 through 5 are in Los Angeles; study intersection 6 is in Glendale.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




2. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of existing
conditions in the study area. The assessment of conditions relevant to this study includes an inventory of
the street and highway systems, traffic volumes on these facilities, and operating conditions at key
intersections. A detailed description of these elements in presented in this chapter.

Existing Highway and Street System

The project site is in the Griffith Park/Atwater Village community of the City of Los Angeles. Primary
regional access to the project area is provided by Interstate 5 (I-5), located between the Crystal Springs
and North Atwater Park sites. Data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) shows
that the average daily traffic (ADT) volume on I-5 near Los Feliz/Griffth Park in 2012 was approximately
256,000 vehicles per day (vpd) (2010 Traffic Volumes on California State Highways, California Department
of Transportation, obtained March 2012). From I-5, the project sites can be accessed via a full interchange
at Los Feliz Boulevard. Additionally, the Crystal Springs candidate site can be accessed via a partial
interchange on Crystal Springs Drive and a partial interchange at Zoo Drive. The North Atwater Park site
is also accessible from a full interchange at Colorado Street.

Local access to the project site is provided by arterial roadways, collector roads, and access roads into
Griffith Park. These roadways are described in Table 1 of this document.

Diagrams of the existing lane configurations at the analyzed intersections are provided in Appendix A.

Existing Alternative Mode Facilities

There is an off-road Class I bicycle trail adjacent to Crystal Springs Drive, which is designated as a Bicyle
Path in the City of Los Angeles 2010 Bicycle Plan, and also designated as part of the Green Bikeway
Network. Additionally, there are on-street Class II bicycle lanes along Los Feliz Boulevard and Crystal
Springs Drive, which is designated as part of the backbone bikeway network for the City. Brunswick Drive
is defined as a Bicycle Friendly Street in the 2010 Bicycle Plan, and is part of a neighborhood bikeway
network.

There are sidewalks, trails, or open space for pedestrians throughout Griffith Park, with sufficient
pedestrian access to the site. From Crystal Springs Drive, there are sidewalks on both sides of Los Feliz
Boulevard. There are no sidewalks on Verdant Street. There are sidewalks on Chevy Chase Drive, near the
North Atwater Park site, but they terminate east of the Verdant Street intersection.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Existing Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service

This section presents the existing peak hour turning movement traffic volumes for the analyzed
intersections, describes the methodology used to assess the traffic conditions at each intersection, and
analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each, indicating volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios and level of
service (LOS).

Existing Traffic Volumes

New traffic counts were conducted for the weekday evening peak period (between 3:00 and 6:00 PM) and
weekend mid-day peak period (between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM) in August 2013. The existing weekday
evening peak hour and weekend mid-day peak hour traffic volumes at the analyzed intersections are
presented in Figure 3. Traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix B.

Level of Service Methodology

LOS is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow, ranging from excellent "free-
flow" conditions at LOS A to overloaded "stop-and-go" conditions at LOS F. LOS D is typically considered
to be the minimum desirable level of service in urban areas.

According to Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (LADOT, June 2013), this study is required to use the
Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) method of intersection capacity calculation (Transportation Research
Circular No. 212, Transportation Research Board, 1980) to analyze the LOS at signalized intersections. The
CMA methodology determines the V/C ratio of an intersection based on the number of approach lanes,
the traffic signal phasing and the traffic volumes. The CMA worksheet developed by LADOT was used to
implement the CMA methodology in this study. The V/C ratio is then used to find the corresponding LOS
based on the definitions in Table 2.

All five of the City of Los Angeles analyzed intersections are currently controlled by traffic signals and are
controlled by the City's Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system. By 2016, the City
plans to have Adaptive Traffic Control Systems (ATCS) at all City intersections as well. In accordance with
LADOT procedures, a capacity increase of 7% was applied to reflect the benefits of ATSAC for Existing
Year analysis, and a 10% increase to reflect the combination of ATSAC & ATCS for the Future Year
analysis. . This increase was not applied to intersection 6, as it is located in the City of Glendale.

Existing Peak Hour Levels of Service

The existing weekday peak hour turning movement volumes presented in Figure 3 were used in
conjunction with the LOS methodology described above to determine existing operating conditions at
each of the study intersections. LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix C.

Table 3 summarizes the existing weekday evening peak hour and Saturday mid-day peak hour V/C ratios
and corresponding LOS at each of the study intersections. The results of this analysis indicate that all six
intersections are currently operating at good levels of service during both peak hours.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




3. TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

Project Traffic Volumes

Development of traffic estimates for the proposed project involved a three-step process including traffic
generation, trip distribution, and traffic assignment.

Project Traffic Generation

Project traffic generation was developed by using rates for baseball fields consistent with those used in
the Sepulveda Basin Sports Complex Traffic Study (2006) and local traffic studies for youth baseball fields
in the City of Los Angeles. The trip generation rate is applied per field. Although both candidate sites
have existing active uses (picnic tables at Crystal Springs and a softball diamond at North Atwater Park),
no trip credits for these uses were taken to provide a conservative assessment. As shown in Table 4, the
project is expected to generate a total of approximately 160 weekday trips, including 40 during the PM
peak hour and approximately 320 Saturday trips including 80 during the mid-day peak hour.

Project Traffic Distribution

The geographic distribution of trips generated by the proposed project is dependent on characteristics of
the street system serving the site, the level of accessibility of routes to and from the proposed project site,
andthe geographic distribution of population from which its users would be drawn. The trip distribution
pattern used in this study was developed in consultation with LADOT and is illustrated in Figure 3. This
includes the following trip distribution by cardinal directions:

    ·    To/from north: 40%
    ·    To/from south: 10%
    ·    To/from east: 10%
    ·    To/from west: 40%

Project Traffic Assignment

The trip generation estimates conditions summarized in Table 4 and the distribution patterns illustrated in
Figure 4 were used to assign the project-generated traffic to the study intersections. Figure 5A illustrates
the estimated project-generated peak hour traffic volumes at each of the analyzed intersections during a
typical weekday evening and Saturday mid-day peak hour for the Crystal Springs site, and Figure 5B for
the North Atwater Park site.

Existing plus Project Traffic Projections

The proposed project traffic volumes were added to the 2013 baseline traffic counts to develop the
Existing plus Project traffic volumes. Figure 6A illustrates the resulting projected Existing plus Project peak
hour traffic volumes for the Crystal Springs site, and Figure 6B for the North Atwater Park site.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Cumulative Base Traffic Volumes

The Cumulative Base traffic projections reflect the changes to existing traffic conditions that can be
expected from three primary sources. The first source is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects
increases in traffic because of regional growth and development. The second source is traffic generated
by specific development projects located within, or in the vicinity of, the study area. The third source is
roadway or intersection capacity enhancements. These factors are described below.

Areawide Traffic Growth

An ambient growth factor of 1.0% per year, compounded, should be applied to adjust the existing base
year traffic volumes to reflect the effects of regional growth and development for the 2017 project
opening year. This adjustment was applied to the base Year 2013 traffic volume data to reflect the effect
of ambient growth of 4.02% in year 2017.

Related Project Traffic Generation and Assignment

Cumulative Base traffic forecasts include the effects of specific cumulative development projects, also
called related projects, expected to be built in the vicinity of the proposed project site prior to the
proposed project's opening year of 2017. LADOT identified three related projects in the vicinity of the
study area and the City of Glendale identified an additional 12 projects. Because the existing Pote Field,
adjacent to the Crystal Springs site, was not in use when the baseline traffic counts used in this study were
collected, it is treated as a related project for this analysis. Table 5 and Figure 7 describe and illustrate the
16 related projects. Figure 8 shows related project only traffic volumes at the study intersections.

Cumulative Baseline Street Improvements

There are currently no planned physical street improvements at the study locations that are scheduled to
be in place by 2017. Signalized study intersections in Los Angeles will be upgraded to the ATCS system
by 2017, resulting in an increase of 0.03.

A multi-modal bridge will be constructed across the Los Angeles River near the two project sites being
considered for the proposed project. The purpose of the bridge is provide improved access and crossings
between the east and west sides of the LA River in this area of the City for pedestrians, bicyclists and
equestrians, and to provide connections to the existing trail networks on the east and west sides of the
River.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Traffic Assignment

Using the estimated trip generation and trip distribution patterns described above, traffic generated by
the related projects was assigned to the street network.

Cumulative Base Traffic Projections

Figure 9 illustrates the Cumulative Base for the Year 2017 at the analyzed intersections for weekday
evening and Saturday mid-day peak hours. The Cumulative Base traffic conditions represent an estimate
of future conditions without development of the proposed project.

Cumulative plus Project Traffic Projections

The proposed project traffic volumes were then added to the Cumulative Base traffic projections to
develop the future plus project traffic forecasts for the opening year 2017 scenario. Figures 10A and 10B
illustrate the resulting projected cumulative plus project peak hour traffic volumes for a typical weekday
evening and Saturday mid-day peak hour in 2017 for the Crystal Springs and North Atwater Park sites,
respectively.

 4. LEVEL OF SERVICE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ANALYSIS

This section presents an analysis of the existing and future, without and with project volumes to
determine the potential traffic impacts of the proposed project on the operating conditions of the
surrounding street system. The traffic impact analysis compares the projected LOS at each study
intersection under Existing and Cumulative plus Project conditions to the Existing and Cumulative Base
conditions to estimate the incremental increase in the V/C ratio caused by the proposed project. This
provides the information needed to assess the potential impact of the project using significance criteria
established by LADOT. Detailed LOS calculations for the proposed project for Existing plus Project and
future year 2017 are included in Appendix C.

Criteria for Determination of Significant Traffic Impact

Five of the six study intersections are in the City of Los Angeles. Significance criteria established by the
City of Los Angeles was used to assess the potential for significant project impacts at these study
intersections.

The City of Los Angeles has established threshold criteria to determine significant traffic impact of a
proposed project in its jurisdiction. Under the LADOT guidelines, an intersection would be significantly
impacted with an increase in V/C ratio equal to or greater than 0.04 for intersections operating at LOS C,
equal to or greater than 0.02 for intersections operating at LOS D, and equal to or greater than 0.01 for
intersections operating at LOS E or F after the addition of project traffic. Intersections operating at LOS A
or B after the addition of the project traffic are not considered significantly impacted regardless of the
project related increase in V/C ratio. The following summarizes the impact criteria:

                  LOS                 Final V/C Ratio     Project-related Increase in V/C
                   C                  >0.700 - 0.800      equal to or greater than 0.040
                   D                  >0.800 - 0.900      equal to or greater than 0.020
                   E or F             >0.900              equal to or greater than 0.010

Intersection 6 is located in the City of Glendale, which considers a significant impact to occur if a project
were to increase the v/c ratio by 0.02 under LOS D, E or F conditions.

Level of Service Analysis

Existing plus Project Traffic Conditions

The resulting Existing plus Project peak hour traffic volumes, illustrated in Figure 6, were analyzed to
determine the projected existing operating conditions with the addition of the proposed project traffic.
The results of the Existing plus Project analysis are presented in Tables 6 and 7. As indicated in the table,
all intersections are projected to continue operating at good levels of service (LOS C or better) during
both peak hours.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Cumulative Base (Year 2017) Traffic Conditions

Cumulative (year 2017) base traffic projections presented in Figure 9 were analyzed to establish future
(year 2017) base operating conditions without the project. The resulting levels of service indicate that all
intersections operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both peak hours.

Cumulative (Year 2017) plus Project Traffic Conditions

The resulting 2017 cumulative plus project peak hour traffic volumes, illustrated in Figures 10A and 10B,
were analyzed to determine the projected future operating conditions with the addition of the proposed
project traffic. The results of the cumulative plus project analysis are presented in Tables 8 and 9 for the
Crystal Springs and Atwater sites, respectively. As indicated in the table, all intersections operate at an
acceptable LOS D or better during both peak hours.

Project Intersection Impacts

To determine whether significant impacts would occur at the study intersections, the Existing plus Project
operating conditions were compared to the existing operating conditions. As shown in Tables 6 and 7,
using the appropriate criteria for determination of significant impacts, under Existing plus Project
conditions, the proposed project would not result in any significant impacts. Likewise, as shown in Tables
8 and 9, the proposed project would not result in any significant impacts for either candidate site.

Intersection Mitigation Measures

The aforementioned traffic impact analysis determined that the proposed project will not result in any
significant traffic impacts. As such, no mitigation measures are needed.

Parking and Site Plan Analysis

This section presents the site plan analysis for the proposed project. It discusses vehicular, bicycle and
pedestrian access to and from the project site and provides recommendations to improve site access,
when warranted.

Crystal Springs Picnic Grounds Site

Vehicular and bicycle access to the Crystal Springs Picnic Grounds is only available from Crystal Springs
Drive and an access road that serves the Ranger Station and Pote Field before terminating in a looping
access road around the formal picnic area. Speed bumps are located along this low-speed access road.
The loop access road also provides direct access to approximately 265 parking spaces that serve
picnickers and other visitors to this area of Griffith Park.

Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Development of the proposed project on the Crystal Springs site under Layout A (shown in Figure 1A),
would include construction of the project on the access loop road, eliminating approximately five parking
spaces. Cul-de-sacs would be constructed at each terminus of the loop road to facilitate turn-around
movements, with no parking allowed along the perimeter of each cul-de-sac. While this could result in
minor inconvenience for some drivers seeking parking, access to all parking would be maintained.

Development of the proposed project on the Crystal Springs site under Layout B (shown in Figure 1B),
would not bisect the loop road and would maintain internal vehicular circulation through the picnic
grounds. No reduction in parking would occur.

Under either layout of the project on the Crystal Springs site, the roadway would be adequate to serve the
anticipated traffic flows. Based on the assumptions used to develop trip generation estimates for this
project, 30 parking spaces per field would be needed on a weekday, when one game is held, or a total of
60 spaces. On weekends when more than one game is held on each field, the need would be doubled
(120 spaces for two fields) because of the overlapping demand from arriving and departing teams when
games are closely scheduled. Except on busy holidays or summer weekend days, this would equate to
less than half of the parking supply in the immediate vicinity and would be expected to be
accommodated.

North Atwater Park Site

Vehicular and bicycle access to the North Atwater Park site is available from Chevy Chase Drive, which
terminates at Verdant Street, an unpaved north-south street at the edge of this project site within North
Atwater Park. At times, access would also be available from the east-west segment of Verdant Street,
which is a private street from Edenhurst Avenue to the north-south segment of Verdant Street. Operable
swing gates are located at the ends of the east-west segment of Verdant Street and these gates are
sometimes closed. Parking is allowed along most of the north-south segment of Verdant Street, although
no stalls are marked. Additional parking is available in the off-street lot in the recently improved area of
North Atwater Park close to the river.

Development of the proposed project on the North Atwater Park site would not include construction of
additional parking in the park. Overflow parking during periods of peak demand would be
accommodated on the surrounding neighborhood streets, similar to what occurs today. This would result
in inconvenience for some project-generated drivers who are unable to find parking adjacent to the
baseball fields and for residents on the adjoining streets. Because the swing gates on Verdant Street can
be closed, it is recommended that the design of improvements to the north-south segment of Verdant
Street prohibit parking at the southern end of the segment that is publicly available, effectively creating a
cul-de-sac that can be used by drivers when the swing gates are closed. Alternatively, the swing gates
could be relocated to the perimeter of a formal cul-de-sac, which could be constructed at the southern
end of the publicly-accessible north-south segment of Verdant Street.

Construction Impact Analysis

The construction impact assessment is based on guidelines in Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide: Your
Resource for Preparing CEQA Analyses in Los Angeles which states that construction traffic impacts
typically could occur as a result of the following types of activities:



                                                                                                          38
Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




    ·    Increases in truck traffic associated with export or import of fill materials and delivery of
         construction materials
    ·    Increases in automobile traffic associated with construction workers traveling to and from the site
    ·    Reductions in existing street capacity from temporary lane closures necessary for the construction
         of roadway improvements, utility relocation and drainage facilities
    ·    Blocking existing vehicle or pedestrian access to other parcels fronting streets

Impacts on traffic conditions associated with construction of projects are typically considered temporary,
short-term adverse impacts, but not significant. LADOT has not established a significance threshold for
such impacts. Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide states that the following factors should be assessed in
determining whether a construction impact would be considered significant:

    ·    Temporary traffic impacts ­ potential impacts on vehicular travelers on roadways
    ·    Temporary loss of access ­ potential impacts on visitors entering and leaving sites
    ·    Temporary loss of bus stops or rerouting of bus lines ­ potential impacts on bus travelers
    ·    Temporary loss of on-street parking ­ potential impacts on parkers

Per the guide, determination of significance is made on a case-by-case basis. The factors should be
evaluated to determine if construction activities could create a potential inconvenience in the
performance of one's daily activities (e.g., an impact on traffic operations) and/or a concern to public
safety.

Two other projects in the vicinity of the two candidate sites would be under construction when
construction of the baseball fields is planned.

    ·    The Northeast Interceptor Sewer (NEIS) Phase 2A and North Outfall Sewer (NOS) Extension will
         construct approximately 4 miles of 7-foot or 8-foot diameter sewer and associated structures
         from the Division Street Shaft Site near Cazador Street & San Fernando Road to the I-5 shaft site
         located in the northern overflow parking lot north of the Pony and Train Rides in Griffith Park, and
         from there to a connection with the existing NOS within the Los Angeles Recreation & Parks
         Central Yard near Baywood Street (two blocks north of Chevy Chase Drive). This project is
         planned to occur from March 2015 to June 2018.

    ·    The Griffith Park Performing Arts Center project will upgrade the existing facility located within
         the park on the west side of Griffith Park Drive. Construction will involve a stage platform,
         restroom renovation, electrical upgrades, lighting and improved accessibility. Construction of this
         project is anticipated to occur in two phases from 2014 to 2016.

Construction of the proposed baseball fields on either candidate site would begin in Summer 2015 and
last for approximately 12 months. Post-construction activities would occur in Fall and Winter 2016-2017,
and the baseball fields would be fully operational in Spring 2017. Construction would require establishing
a staging area at the selected site, delivering materials and equipment, constructing the project, and finish
work such as landscaping. On-site activities would include site preparation, grading, construction of
dugouts, scoreboard and fencing, and paving. While no detailed estimates of worker or material




                                                                                                          39
Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields

quantities are available at this time, the nature of the project itself (with no building construction and
limited on-site improvements) and the one-year construction duration suggest that these quantities
would be relatively modest.

If the project were built on the Crystal Springs site, Pote Field and a portion of the Crystal Springs Picnic
Area would remain open during construction. If the project were constructed at the North Atwater Park
site, a portion of that park would remain open during construction. No lanes within public streets would
be closed during construction, however, nor would any transit stops or marked bicycle facilities be closed
or relocated.

The project will be designed, constructed, and operated following all applicable laws, regulations,
ordinances, and formally adopted City standards including but not limited to:

·        Los Angeles Municipal Code
·        Bureau of Engineering Standard Plans
·        Urban Forest Program/Tree Care Manual
·        Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction
·        Work Area Traffic Control Handbook
·        Additions and Amendments to the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction

Construction traffic management plans will be prepared and submitted to LADOT for review and approval
prior to the start of any construction work. These plans would include such elements as the designation
of haul routes for construction-related trucks, the location of access to the construction site, temporary
traffic control devices or flagmen, travel time restrictions (if any) for construction-related traffic, and
designated staging and parking areas for workers and equipment.

The City of Los Angeles allows major and secondary arterials to be used as truck routes. The City's policy
is to allow trucks to also travel in a "reasonable fashion" to and from a work site, including over collector
and local streets. The City of Los Angeles reviews each haul-route permit for specific application of its
general guidelines. Potential haul routes for the project include segments of Los Feliz Boulevard,
Colorado Boulevard, San Fernando Road, Griffith Park Drive, Crystal Springs Drive, Chevy Chase Drive, and
Brunswick Avenue. While the City of Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) prohibits the use of certain
segments of specific streets by vehicles over 6,000 gross weight (LAMC Section 80.36.1), none of the
potential truck routes listed above are so restricted and the anticipated level of haul truck traffic for site
clearance or material delivery is not expected to result in a significant traffic impact.

The number of construction workers needed is unknown at this time. Construction worker traffic would
depend on the level of effort during various construction phases. While not definitively known, the
number of worker and truck trips is expected to be roughly similar to or less than the peak hour trip
generation associated with the proposed project once it is in operation. Therefore, traffic-related impacts
during construction would be less than or similar to those identified above for project operation. Given
the existing baseline levels of service at the study intersections near either project site (LOS C or better), it
is not expected that the combination of truck traffic and employee traffic during construction would cause
temporary adverse impacts at the study intersections during the construction period.




                                                                                                              40

No partial or full lane closures of public streets would occur during construction of the project on either
candidate site, and would result in a less than significant impact. It is noted, however, that a scenery
warehousing business located at 4000 Chevy Chase Drive which is currently served by driveways on both
Chevy Chase Drive and on Verdant Street. During construction of the project on the North Atwater Park
site, access would be maintained onto Verdant Street during normal business hours. Because paving
Verdant Street is not proposed as part of the project, it is not anticipated that a full closure of Verdant
Street will be required during construction of the project.

Parking for construction workers will be provided either within the park near the selected site or at a
designated off-site off-street location, and would result in a less than significant impact.




                                                                                                        41

5. CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ANALYSIS

This chapter presents the regional transportation system impact analysis conducted in accordance with
the procedures outlined in 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (Metro,
October 2010).

Regional Traffic Impact Analysis

The CMP guidelines require that the first issue to be addressed is the determination of the geographic
scope of the study area. The criteria for determining the study area for CMP arterial monitoring
intersections and for freeway monitoring locations are:

    ·    All CMP arterial monitoring intersections where the proposed project will add 50 or more trips
         during either the AM or PM peak hours of adjacent street traffic.

    ·    All CMP mainline freeway monitoring locations where the proposed project will add 150 or more
         trips, in either direction, during either the AM or PM peak hours.

The CMP traffic impact analysis guidelines establish that a significant project impact occurs when the
following threshold is exceeded:

    ·    The proposed project increases traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C 0.02),
         causing LOS F (V/C > 1.00).

    ·    If the facility is already at LOS F, a significant impact occurs when the proposed project increases
         traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C 0.02).

Arterial Monitoring Station Analysis

There are no CMP arterial monitoring facilities in or near the project study area. As such, no further
analysis of CMP arterial intersections is required and CMP arterial intersection impacts are considered to
be less than significant.

Freeway Mainline Monitoring Station Analysis

This section presents an analysis of potential project impacts on the regional transportation system. This
analysis was conducted in accordance with the transportation impact analysis procedures outlined in the
CMP. The nearest CMP mainline freeway monitoring location nearest to the project site is I-5 south of the
Colorado Boulevard Extension. According to the incremental project trip generation estimates developed
in Chapter 3 and the project only traffic volumes illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the proposed project is not
expected to add sufficient new traffic to exceed the freeway analysis criteria at this location.

Since incremental project-related traffic in any direction during either peak hour is projected to be less
than the minimum criteria of 150 vehicles per hour (VPH), no further CMP freeway analysis is required and
CMP freeway impacts are considered to be less than significant.



                                                                                                            42
Traffic Study for the Crystal Springs Baseball Fields
October 2013




Regional Transit Impact Analysis

Potential increases in transit person trips generated by the proposed project were estimated as follows.
Section B.8.4 of the CMP provides a methodology for estimating the number of transit trips expected to
result from a proposed project based on the projected number of vehicle trips. The CMP requires that the
transit impact analysis include local services within ¼ mile of the project and express bus and rail routes
within two miles of the project. Potential increases in transit person trips generated by the proposed
project were evaluated based on the CMP methodology. This methodology assumes an Average Vehicle
Ridership (AVR) factor of 1.4 to estimate the number of person trips to and from the project and then
provides guidance regarding the percent of person trips assigned to public transit depending on the type
of use (commercial/other; residential) and its proximity to transit services.

There are five fixed-route transit lines within ¼ mile of the project area, and six express transit line (Metro
734) within two miles of the project area. Assuming an average bus seating capacity of 30 to 40 seats, the
total number of seats during peak hours can range from 900 to 1200.

The proposed project generates the highest number of trips during a Saturday mid-day peak hour.
Multiplying the weekday PM peak hour trips by an AVR of 1.4 estimates that the proposed project could
generate a total of 112 person trips.

Based on parameters in the CMP, a factor of 3.5% was applied to person trips generated to estimate
transit trips. The project may therefore generate approximately four or fewer transit trips in either peak
hour.

The CMP does not have a threshold for determining the significance of impacts on the transit system,
however, at these levels, project-related impacts on the regional transit system would not be considered
significant.




                                                                                                            43

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This study was undertaken to analyze the potential for traffic impacts resulting from the proposed
baseball fields within the Crystal Springs Picnic Area or in North Atwater Park in Los Angeles, California.
The key findings and conclusions of the study are summarized below:


    ·    The proposed project is composed of two baseball fields that would be used for youth baseball
         activities. The Crystal Springs site is located within the Crystal Springs Picnic Area. Layout A
         would displace approximately seven picnic tables; Layout B would displace approximately 56
         picnic tables. Under either option, the displaced picnic tables would be replaced elsewhere in
         Griffith Park. The North Atwater Park site is located near Chevy Chase Drive & Verdant Street and
         is currently occupied by open space and one softball field.

    ·    Detailed intersection capacity and operation analyses were conducted at six intersections in Los
         Angeles and Glendale near the project site for weekday evening (3:00 to 6:00 PM) and Saturday
         mid-day (11:00 AM to 2:00 PM). All intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels of
         service.

    ·    The project is estimated to generate a total of approximately 160 daily weekday trips, including
         approximately 40 trips during the PM peak hour and approximately 320 Saturday daily trips
         including 80 trips during the mid-day peak hour.

    ·    The future scenario of Year 2017 (opening year) was analyzed in the traffic study. Year 2017 base
         conditions were estimated by adding a 1% growth rate to the existing traffic volumes. Specific
         related projects proposed in the vicinity of the project were added to the model projection to
         develop Cumulative Baseline traffic projections. The project traffic volumes were added to the
         above Cumulative Base scenarios to calculate cumulative plus project traffic projections.

    ·    Using the appropriate significant impact criteria for each analyzed intersection, the project was
         found to result in less than significant impacts under Existing plus Project conditions and under
         Cumulative plus Project conditions. Impacts to CMP roadway and transit facilities were also found
         to be less than significant.

    ·    Potential construction-period traffic impacts were qualitatively assessed and found to be less than
         significant.




                                                                                                         44
