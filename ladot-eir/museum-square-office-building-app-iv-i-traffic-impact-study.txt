Crain & Associates has prepared this traffic impact study to assess the potential traffic

impacts of the Museum Square Office Building, a proposed 253,962 square-foot office

building to be located in the Wilshire Community Plan Area of the City of Los Angeles.

The project is located at 5757 Wilshire Boulevard, on the same site as an existing,

larger office building. The site is bounded by Curson Avenue to the west, Wilshire

Boulevard to the south, Masselin Avenue to the east, and two multi-family residential

developments to the north. Project parking would be provided via a surface parking lot

and a multi-level parking structure on the project site. The location of the project site is

shown in Figure 1, Project Site Vicinity Map.

This analysis was prepared in accordance with the assumptions, methodologies, and

procedures outlined in the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT)

Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (May 2012). The analysis is also consistent with

the guidelines in the Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP).

This report presents the results of a detailed analysis of existing (2013) and future

(2016) traffic conditions during both the AM and PM peak hours at the following 23

signalized study intersections and two residential street segment locations:

The project under consideration is the proposed Museum Square Office Building to be

located at 5757 Wilshire Boulevard in the Wilshire Community Plan Area of the City of

Los Angeles. The proposed 253,962 square-foot office building would be added to the

same site as an existing, larger office building. The site is bounded by Curson Avenue

to the west, Wilshire Boulevard to the south, Masselin Avenue to the east, and two

multi-family residential developments to the north. The proposed office building would

be situated along the west boundary of the project site, abutting Curson Avenue and

centered between 6th Street and Wilshire Boulevard.

The project would provide on-site parking via a surface lot and a multi-level parking

structure. Under existing conditions, the surface parking lot provides 117 spaces and

the parking structure provides 1,373 spaces, for a total of 1,490 spaces.           With

construction of the proposed project, the existing surface lot would be reduced in size

(by 65 spaces) and the parking structure would be increased in size (by 615 spaces)

through the addition of two new levels, totaling 2,040 parking spaces on-site.

Vehicular access to the project site parking would remain generally unchanged with

construction of the proposed office building. The two full-access driveways intersecting

the east side of Curson Avenue, providing access to both the surface lot and parking

structure, would continue to be provided. The northerly Curson Avenue driveway would

be modified from its existing configuration of dual entry lanes and a single exit lane to

provide a single entry lane and dual exit lanes. The full-access driveway and exit-only

driveway intersecting the west side of Masselin Avenue, providing access to the parking

structure, would continue to be provided. The full-access service/drop-off driveway for

the existing office building, also intersecting the west side of Masselin Avenue, would

continue to be provided. Another minor change in project access would be the addition

                                            5
of a drop-off area for the proposed office building along the east side of Curson Avenue,

approximately 350 feet north of Wilshire Boulevard. The conceptual project site plan for

the project is shown in Figure 3, Conceptual Project Site Plan.

                             ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING



The proposed project site is located along the north side of Wilshire Boulevard, at 5757

Wilshire Boulevard, between Curson Avenue and Masselin Avenue. Located along the

Miracle Mile within the Wilshire Community Plan Area, surrounding the project site is a

diverse urban area composed of residential, commercial retail and office, and

institutional uses, as well as recreational uses and public space.

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is located approximately one-quarter

mile west of the project site. The LACMA campus consists of a series of buildings

including the Pavilion for Japanese Art, Bing Center, Art of the Americas Building,

Hammer Building, Ahmanson Building, BP Grand Entrance, Broad Contemporary Art

Museum, Resnick Pavilion, and LACMA West. Hancock Park, the La Brea Tar Pits, and

the Page Museum are all located on the same block containing the LACMA (generally

bounded by Fairfax Avenue, Curson Avenue, 6th Street, and Wilshire Boulevard).

Low-to-medium density residential uses are interspersed with areas of higher density

residential uses throughout the Wilshire Community Plan Area. Park La Brea, a multi-

family residential community, is located approximately one-quarter mile north of the

project site. Commercial uses are concentrated along major boulevards in the project

area, including Beverly Boulevard, 3rd Street, Wilshire Boulevard, and Olympic

Boulevard. Fairfax Avenue and La Brea Avenue, west and east of the project site,

respectively, also serve as primary commercial corridors.        The Grove at Farmer's

Existing (2013) Traffic Volumes

Traffic volumes for existing conditions at the study locations were obtained from manual

traffic counts conducted on Tuesday - April 19, 2011 (2 intersections), Tuesday -

November 27, 2012 (13 intersections), and Wednesday - January 16, 2013.                 In

accordance with the current

LADOT Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (May 2012), the intersection traffic counts

for this study were completed on a typical weekday during the morning and afternoon

peak commute periods, which range from 7:00 to 10:00 AM and 3:00 to 6:00 PM,

respectively.

Peak-hour volumes were determined individually for each intersection based on the

highest-volume four consecutive 15-minute periods for all vehicular movements.          In

order to represent existing conditions in 2013, the traffic counts conducted in 2011 and

2012 were factored upward using a 1.0 percent ambient growth factor, which is

consistent with the growth factor approved by LADOT for use in this traffic impact

analysis. The existing (2013) AM and PM peak-hour volumes at the study intersections

are illustrated in Figures 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The intersection count data sheets

are provided in Appendix A.

Daily machine traffic counts were conducted on November 27, 2012 for the two

residential street segments that were analyzed.       These count volumes were also

increased by 1.0 percent to provide existing daily volumes representative of the existing

study year, 2013. The existing residential street volumes are provided in Table 11 on

page 63. The daily traffic count data sheets are also contained in Appendix A.

Information pertaining to intersection characteristics, such as geometrics, traffic signal

operations, and on-street parking restrictions were obtained from field checks and City

engineering plans. The existing lane configurations and traffic control conditions for the

study intersections are illustrated in Appendix B.

Existing Public Transportation

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority ("Metro") and LADOT

provide several bus lines in the project study area. A number of these bus routes are

within a reasonable walking distance of the project site (approximately one-quarter

mile), providing public transportation access for employees of the proposed project.

These lines include Metro Local Lines 20, 212/312, and 217; Metro Rapid Lines 720

and 780; and LADOT DASH Fairfax. The bus routes in the project study area are

shown in Figure 5. The public transit routes serving the immediate project vicinity are

described in detail below.

Metro Bus Service

   ·   Metro Local Line 20 provides east-west local service between the City of Santa

       Monica and Downtown Los Angeles. The route travels primarily along Wilshire

       Boulevard, with stops in Westwood, the City of Beverly Hills, the Wilshire

       Community Plan Area, Koreatown, and Westlake. Line 20 operates daily with

       headways of approximately 5 to 15 minutes during the weekday AM and PM

       peak hours.     Saturday and Sunday service is provided with headways of

LADOT Bus Service

   ·   LADOT DASH Fairfax is a shuttle service that provides east-west local access

       throughout the Wilshire Community Plan area (including the Miracle Mile, Park

       La Brea, and Fairfax Village communities), the City of West Hollywood, and the

       Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Near the project site, DASH Fairfax operates in a

       clockwise loop on Hauser Boulevard, 6th Street, La Brea Avenue, Wilshire

       Boulevard, and Fairfax Avenue.         DASH Fairfax operates every weekday,

       between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM, with headways of approximately 30 minutes.

       Saturday service is also provided, between 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM, with

       headways of approximately 30 minutes. In the vicinity of the project site, bus

       stops are provided on Wilshire Boulevard at Curson Avenue and Masselin

       Avenue.

Given the proximity of the project site to these services and the availability of transfer

opportunities, the project is well served by public transit. For this reason, it is expected

that some of the person trips generated by the project will utilize public transportation as

their primary travel mode, instead of using private vehicles.

Analysis of Existing (2013) Traffic Conditions

The 23 study intersections listed below were analyzed for existing traffic conditions. All

of these intersections are signalized. They were selected in consultation with LADOT

for the analysis of potential project traffic impacts. Per current LADOT policy, when

determining which intersections should be included in the impact analysis for

development projects, only signalized locations should be included.         Unsignalized

intersections should be evaluated solely to determine the need for the installation of a

traffic signal or other traffic control devices, but will not be included in the impact

analysis. The existing peak-hour traffic volumes for these intersections were discussed

previously and presented in Figures 4(a) and 4(b).          These volumes, along with

information pertaining to intersection geometrics, traffic signal operations and on-street

parking restrictions, were analyzed using established traffic engineering techniques.

The two residential street segments below were also analyzed for potential traffic

impacts. These locations were also selected in consultation with LADOT.

   1. Curson Ave., south of 8th St.
   2. Masselin Ave., south of 8th St.

The LADOT Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (May 2012) require the use of the

Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) methodology to analyze signalized intersections.

This methodology is based on procedures outlined in the Transportation Research

Board Circular 212, Interim Materials on Highway Capacity.              Using the CMA

procedures, a determination can be made of the operating characteristics of an

intersection in terms of the Level of Service for different levels of traffic volume and

other variables, such as critical signal phases and the number and type of traffic lanes.

The term "Level of Service" (LOS) describes the quality of traffic flow. LOS A through C

are indicative of excellent-to-good traffic flow conditions. LOS D corresponds with fair

conditions that may experience substantial delay during portions of the peak hours, but

without excessive backups. LOS E represents poor conditions, with volumes at or near

the capacity of the intersection and long lines of vehicles that may have to wait through

several signal cycles.    LOS F is characteristic of failure (i.e., the intersection is

overloaded, vehicular movements may be restricted or prevented, and delays and

queue lengths become increasingly longer).

                                            22
A determination of the LOS at an intersection can be obtained through a summation of

the critical movement volumes, on a per lane basis, at that intersection.                     Critical

movement volumes are the highest total conflicting traffic volumes for each signal

phase. Once the sum of the critical movement volumes has been obtained, the values

in Table 1 can be used to determine the applicable LOS.

Capacity is the total maximum hourly volume of vehicles in the intersection critical lanes

that has a reasonable expectation of passing through the intersection under the

prevailing roadway and traffic conditions.            For planning purposes, the capacity for

signalized intersections equates to the maximum critical movement value at LOS E, as

indicated in Table 1.

The CMA values used in this study were calculated by dividing the sum of the critical

movement volumes by the appropriate capacity value for the type of signal control

present or proposed at the subject intersections. A description of the different LOS and

their corresponding CMA values is shown in Table 2.

Applying this analysis procedure, the CMA value and corresponding LOS can be

calculated for each study intersection for Existing (2013) traffic conditions.    These

standard CMA calculations are also adjusted to account for signal enhancements not

considered in the CMA methodology, including the effects of intersections currently

operating under the City's Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system

or the upgraded Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS). ATSAC/ATCS is a highly

sophisticated computerized system that continually monitors traffic demand at

signalized intersections within the system and modifies signal timing in real time to

maximize capacity and decrease overall delay.          The ATSAC system has been

recognized to increase intersection capacity by approximately seven percent.         The

upgrade to ATCS is able to increase capacity by an additional three percent, resulting in

a total 10 percent increase in intersection capacity. Therefore, per LADOT policy, the

standard CMA values were decreased by 0.070 where only the ATSAC system is in

effect and by 0.100 where the combined ATSAC/ATCS is in effect.

Seventeen of the 23 study intersections are operating with full ATSAC/ATCS signal

enhancements currently, while six of the study intersections have only the ATSAC

system in effect. These six study intersections are scheduled to be upgraded with full

ATSAC/ATCS signal enhancements by 2014.


                                           24
The analyses of Existing (2013) AM and PM peak-hour conditions at the study

intersections are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, 11 of the 23 study

intersections currently operate at LOS C or better during both peak hours, six

intersections currently operate at LOS D or better during both peak hours, and the

remaining six intersections currently operate at LOS E during one or both peak hours.

None of the study intersections currently operate at LOS F during either peak hour. All

CMA/LOS calculations were performed using the standard LADOT LOS Worksheet.

These CMA/LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix C.

                                     PROJECT TRAFFIC



The following section describes the methodology and procedures used to determine the

trip generation, distribution and assignment of traffic resulting from the proposed project.

The project entails the construction of a proposed 253,962 square-foot office building on

the Museum Square site. The site is developed with a larger office building, along with

a parking structure, both of which will remain. Project vehicular access and parking are

described at the end of this section.

Project Trip Generation

In order to develop the traffic characteristics of the proposed project, the latest version

of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation (9th Edition, 2012)

manual was used. The trip generation equations and rates in the ITE manual are

nationally recognized and are used as the basis for most traffic studies conducted in the

City of Los Angeles and surrounding region. Information was obtained from the Trip

Generation manual for ITE Land Use Code (LUC) 710 ­ General Office Building. Table

4 presents the trip generation equations used to generate the daily and peak-hour traffic

volumes for the proposed project.

Given that the proposed office building would be added to the Museum Square site that

already contains an existing office building, with the two buildings sharing site access


                                                28
and parking, the new trips attributable to the project have been analyzed in conjunction

with the existing office building and its trips. It should be noted that the existing office

building is approximately 530,000 gross square feet in size, of which approximately

502,175 gross square feet is for office uses and approximately 27,825 gross square feet

is for restaurant uses. The restaurants include Starbucks, Baja Fresh, and Mixt Greens

establishments, among others. Considering that the restaurant uses advertise to the

outside, they were not considered to be ancillary uses to the existing office uses and,

therefore, were not included in determining the site trip generation for the combined

office uses.

Applying the trip equations in Table 4, two sets of trip generations were calculated; i.e.,

one set for the combined square footages of the existing office and proposed office

uses, and one set for only the square footage of the existing office use. The difference

between the two sets of trip generations provides the baseline daily, AM peak-hour and

PM peak-hour trips attributable to the proposed project. It should be noted that these

baseline calculations do not account for such trip-reducing factors as significant transit

usage and/or walk trip potential.      As these trip-reducing factors are an important

consideration in determining the actual traffic-generating characteristics of a project,

adjustments to the baseline trip generations should be included.

The use of public transportation is an important consideration in the evaluation of a

project's trip-generating potential.     As noted previously in the Existing Public

Transportation section of this report, the project is well served by Metro and LADOT bus

lines. These transit operators provide both local and regional routes that are readily

accessible to project employees.       Additionally, the forthcoming Wilshire Bus Rapid

Transit (BRT) Project, which will convert the existing curb lane along Wilshire Boulevard

to bus and right-turn-only operation during the weekday AM and PM peak periods

throughout the project study area, will improve area transit service. Significant transit

                                            29
use is not accounted for in the ITE Trip Generation trip equations.        Therefore, the

project trip generation should be adjusted to account for transit usage.

Additionally, "walk-in" trips to and from the project site are also expected. Given the mix

of land uses existing and proposed within the Wilshire Community Plan Area, it is

expected that people working, living, and shopping in the area will consider walking

between adjacent and nearby developments.          Well-situated along the Miracle Mile

segment of Wilshire Boulevard and surrounded by residential, recreational, commercial

retail, and institutional uses, the project site is expected to be attractive and conducive

to pedestrian traffic. This walk-in patronage will reduce the number of vehicle trips

generated by the project. Based on these vehicle trip-reducing factors, a combined

transit/walk trip reduction of 15 percent has been applied to the project's baseline trips,

as discussed with and approved by LADOT staff.

Based on the trip generation equations and aforementioned trip reduction, the estimated

project trip generations were determined.        Table 5 summarizes the project trip

generation. As shown, it is estimated that the proposed project would generate 1,388

net trips per day, including 228 trips during the AM peak hour and 242 trips during the

PM peak hour. These peak-hour trips were used to analyze project impacts at the study

intersections.

Project Trip Distribution

Estimation of the geographic distribution of project trips was the next step in the

analytical process. The primary factors affecting the trip distribution pattern are the

nature of the use, existing traffic patterns, characteristics of the surrounding roadway

system, geographic location of the project site and its proximity to freeways and major

travel routes, and residential areas from which employees of the project would likely be

  Project Trip Assignment

  The general distribution percentages shown in Table 6 were then disaggregated and

  assigned to specific routes and intersections that are expected to be used for project

  access. The estimated project trip assignment percentages at the study intersections

  were reviewed and approved by LADOT staff and are presented in Figure 5. Applying

  these inbound and outbound percentages to the project trip generation, the traffic

  volumes for the proposed project were determined for the study intersections. These

Project Parking and Access

Parking for the proposed project would be provided in accordance with the requirements

of the City of Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC). The project would provide parking

via a surface lot and a multi-level parking structure, both of which exist and would be

modified in conjunction with construction of the project. Based on the project planning

submittal package prepared by the project architect, the existing site parking

requirement is 1,468 parking spaces. Under existing conditions, the surface parking lot

provides 117 spaces and the parking structure provides 1,373 spaces, for a total of

1,490 spaces.    Thus, the existing site parking requirement is satisfied.     With the

proposed project, the existing surface lot would be reduced in size (by 65 spaces) and

the parking structure would be increased in size (by 615 spaces) through the addition of

two new parking levels. After project completion, a total of 2,040 parking spaces would

be provided on site, which would exceed the total code parking requirement of 1,857

spaces for existing and proposed uses based on the project planning submittal

package.   Therefore, no off-site parking impacts are anticipated as a result of this

project.

Vehicular access to the project site parking would remain generally unchanged with

construction of the proposed office building. The two full-access driveways intersecting

the east side of Curson Avenue, providing access to both the surface lot and parking

structure, would continue to be provided. The northerly Curson Avenue driveway would

be modified from its existing configuration of dual entry lanes and a single exit lane to

provide a single entry lane and dual exit lanes. The full-access driveway and exit-only

driveway intersecting the west side of Masselin Avenue, providing access to the parking

structure, would continue to be provided. The full-access service/drop-off driveway for

the existing office building, also intersecting the west side of Masselin Avenue, would

continue to be provided. Another minor change in project access would be the addition

of a drop-off area for the proposed office building along the east side of Curson Avenue,

approximately 350 feet north of Wilshire Boulevard. The conceptual project site plan for

the project was shown in Figure 3.

                 EXISTING PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS



Based on the December 16, 2010 decision of the California Sixth District Court of

Appeal in the Sunnyvale West Neighborhood Association v. City of Sunnyvale City

Council case, an additional traffic impact analysis has been performed for the proposed

project. In the Sunnyvale case, the Court of Appeal found, based on the facts of that

case, the impacts of a project must be compared "against current, existing physical

conditions." While the facts of the Sunnyvale case may be distinguishable from this

case, in the interest of fullest disclosure an analysis of Existing (2013) Plus Project AM

and PM peak-hour conditions was performed.

The Existing (2013) Plus Project traffic volumes were determined by superimposing the

project-only traffic volumes onto the Existing (2013) traffic volumes. The Existing (2013)

Plus Project traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown in Figures 7(a) and

7(b) for the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The analysis of Existing (2013) Plus

Project traffic conditions at the study intersections was performed using the analysis

procedures described previously in this report. The results of the analysis of Existing

(2013) Plus Project traffic conditions at the study intersections are summarized in Table

8 of the following section and are discussed therein.

                            FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS



There are a number of other projects either under construction or planned for

development in the surrounding area that may contribute future traffic to the study

locations. For this reason, the analysis of future traffic conditions was expanded to

include potential traffic volume increases expected to be generated by those other

projects. In order to evaluate future traffic conditions in the project area, an analysis of

Existing (2013) traffic volumes was first conducted, as described previously. For the

analysis of future conditions, an ambient traffic growth factor of 1.0 percent per year

was applied to these existing volumes at the 23 study intersections to develop future

year (2016) baseline traffic volumes. As the proposed project is currently estimated to

be completed in 2016, that year was selected as the future study year, as agreed upon

with LADOT during the traffic study scoping process.

The inclusion of the annual growth factor generally accounts for area-wide traffic

increases. To ensure a conservative estimate of cumulative traffic conditions, the traffic

generated by "related projects" in the study area was also added to the future baseline

traffic volumes.   The total future volumes, including those due to related projects,

formed the basis for the Future (2016) Without Project condition. Finally, the traffic

expected to be generated by the project was analyzed as an incremental addition to the

Future (2016) Without Project condition, resulting in the Future (2016) With Project

condition.

Ambient Traffic Growth

Based on an analysis of the trends in traffic growth in the Wilshire Community Plan

Area, LADOT recommended the application of an ambient traffic growth factor of 1.0

percent per year. This growth factor was used to account for increases in traffic due to

potential development projects not yet proposed or outside the study area. The ambient
                                            40
traffic growth factor was applied to the existing (2013) traffic volumes to develop the

estimated baseline volumes for the future study year (2016).

Related Projects

In addition to the use of the ambient growth rate, listings of potential projects located in

the surrounding area ("related projects") that might be developed or under construction

within the study time frame were obtained from LADOT, City of Beverly Hills Planning

Department, and City of West Hollywood Planning Department. Recently published

traffic studies and environmental reports for development projects in the area were also

reviewed. Related projects from these sources and within an approximate 2.0-mile

radius of the project site were included. Refinement of the information resulted in a total

of 46 related projects in the surrounding area that could add traffic to the study

intersections. Of the 46 related projects, 26 are located in the City of Los Angeles, 6

are in the City of Beverly Hills, and 14 are in the City of West Hollywood.

The locations of the related projects are shown in Figure 8.          The related project

locations, descriptions, and trip generation estimates are listed in Table 7. This list of

related projects accurately reflects the known related project proposals at the time the

traffic study Memorandum of Understanding was scoped with and approved by LADOT.

The number of trips expected to be generated by the related projects was obtained from

information provided by public agencies, traffic studies and environmental reports, to the

extent available.     For related projects with incomplete peak-hour directional

(inbound/outbound) distribution information, directional estimates were determined by

applying the appropriate directional splits from the ITE Trip Generation (9th Edition,

2012) manual. This ITE Trip Generation information is provided in Appendix D.

For the analysis of Future (2016) Without Project traffic conditions, each related

project's trip generation was distributed and assigned to the study area circulation

system, using methodologies similar to those previously described for the proposed

project trip distribution and assignment. Summing the individual related project traffic

volume assignments, the total related project traffic volumes at the study intersections

were calculated and are shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b) for the AM and PM peak hours,

respectively.

It should be noted that the inclusion of these related projects, as described, results in

future (2016) traffic condition forecasts that are conservative for the purposes of impact

analysis. As stated previously, the 1.0 percent ambient traffic growth factor, approved

by LADOT, accounts for the general traffic growth expected throughout the study area.

The overlay of traffic volumes resulting from the 46 identified related projects represents

a conservative projection of future traffic volumes. There is the likelihood that some of

the identified projects will not proceed or be constructed as described.         It is also

probable that some of these projects will be delayed in their construction beyond the

future (buildout) study year of the proposed project. In addition, none of the mitigation

measures proposed in the traffic analyses performed for these related projects have

been assumed under future conditions. Therefore, the future condition of the study area

roadway infrastructure has also been forecast conservatively.

Highway System Improvements

In order to better analyze future traffic conditions in the project area, an investigation

regarding relevant future transportation improvements to the roadway system

infrastructure in the study area was conducted. A number of traffic improvements were

identified as scheduled for implementation in order to make more efficient and effective

use of the existing street system.

All of the study intersections currently operating on the City's ATSAC system only are

scheduled to be upgraded with ATCS enhancements by 2014.               As described in a

previous section, the ATSAC/ATCS signal enhancements have been recognized to

increase intersection capacities by approximately ten percent at locations where they

have been installed. These intersection capacity improvements have been incorporated

into the analysis of future (2016) traffic conditions.

In addition to these traffic signal enhancements, the Wilshire Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)

Project has been formally approved and is scheduled to be constructed and operational

by the end of 2015. As part of the Wilshire BRT Project, the existing curb lane along

Wilshire Boulevard would be converted to bus and right-turn-only operation during the

weekday AM (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and PM (4:00 to 7:00 PM) peak periods throughout the

project study area. These geometric lane changes to the eastbound and westbound

approaches to the six study intersections along Wilshire Boulevard have been included

in the future (2016) traffic conditions analysis and are depicted in Appendix B.

A review of the current City of Los Angeles Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and

Bureau of Engineering Street Improvement Master Schedule did not reveal any other

improvement projects that would significantly affect operations at the study intersection

locations.

Analysis of Future (2016) Traffic Conditions

The analysis of future traffic conditions at the study intersections was performed using

the same analysis procedures described previously in this report. As described earlier,

for the analysis of future project traffic impacts, the aforementioned highway system

improvements were incorporated where appropriate.          At study locations where no

improvements to lane geometries were identified, existing roadway geometric

characteristics were assumed to prevail.



                                              51
As described earlier, future (2016) baseline traffic volumes for the Without Project

condition were determined by superimposing area-wide ambient traffic growth and the

total related projects traffic volumes onto the existing (2013) traffic volumes. The Future

(2016) Without Project traffic volumes are depicted in Figures 10(a) and 10(b) for the

AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

Project volumes [Figures 6(a) and 6(b)], as determined earlier, were then added to the

Future (2016) Without Project traffic volumes to develop the Future (2016) With Project

volumes. The Future (2016) With Project volumes were then used to determine traffic

impacts directly attributable to the proposed project. The Future (2016) With Project AM

and PM peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figures 11(a) and 11(b), respectively.

The results of the analysis of existing and future traffic conditions at the study

intersections are summarized in Table 8. As shown in Table 8, the addition of project-

related traffic to existing traffic conditions would deteriorate the LOS at four study

intersection during the PM peak hour. No deterioration in LOS would occur during the

AM peak hour.     Under Existing (2013) Plus Project conditions, 11 of the 23 study

intersections would operate at LOS C or better during both peak hours, six intersections

would operate at LOS D or better during both peak hours, and the remaining six

intersections would operate at LOS E during one or both peak hours. None of the study

intersections would deteriorate to LOS F operations during either peak hour.

As shown, under Future (2016) Without Project and Future (2016) With Project

conditions, traffic operations at all Wilshire Boulevard intersections are expected to

deteriorate when compared with existing conditions following the implementation of the

Wilshire BRT Project, which reduces the number of eastbound and westbound through

travel lanes during the AM and PM peak periods. Under Future (2016) Without Project

conditions, eight of the 23 study intersections would operate at LOS C or better during

both peak hours, three intersections would operate at LOS D or better during both peak

hours, and 12 intersections would operate at LOS E or F during one or both peak hours.

Under Future (2016) With Project conditions, seven of the 23 study intersections would

continue to operate at LOS C or better during both peak hours, four intersections would

operate at LOS D or better during both peak hours, and 12 intersections would operate

at LOS E or F during one or both peak hours. Following the addition of project-related

traffic, five study intersections would experience deteriorations in LOS during the AM

peak hour only (no change in LOS during the PM peak hour).                The CMA/LOS

calculation worksheets for existing and future conditions are included in Appendix C.

Significant Traffic Impact Criteria

LADOT defines a significant intersection traffic impact attributable to a project based on

a "stepped scale", with intersections experiencing high CMA values being more

sensitive to additional traffic than those operating with more available capacity.

According to LADOT policy, a significant impact is identified as an increase in the CMA

value, due to project-related traffic under future buildout conditions, of 0.010 or more

when the final (with project) LOS is E or F, a CMA increase of 0.020 or more when the

final LOS is D, or an increase of 0.040 or more when the final LOS is C. No significant

impacts are deemed to occur at LOS A or B, as these operating conditions exhibit

sufficient surplus capacities to accommodate large traffic increases with little effect on

traffic delays. These criteria are summarized in Table 9.
                                           60
                                         Table 9
               LADOT Criteria for Significant Intersection Traffic Impacts

       LOS          Final CMA Value        Project-Related Increase in CMA Value
         C            > 0.700 - 0.800            equal to or greater than 0.040
         D            > 0.800 - 0.900            equal to or greater than 0.020
        E, F          > 0.900                    equal to or greater than 0.010


Based on these criteria, and as shown previously in Table 8, no significant intersection

impact is expected to result due to the project under Existing conditions. The project is

expected to result in significant impacts to the following five study intersections under

Future conditions, prior to mitigation:

     6. Fairfax Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
     9. Curson Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (AM peak hour)
   11. Masselin Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
   13. Hauser Blvd./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
   19. La Brea Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (AM and PM peak hours)

Mitigation measures recommended to address these significant impacts are described

in the Mitigation Measures section of this report.

Residential Street Impact Analysis

In order to address local residential neighborhood concerns, traffic impacts were

analyzed on two study area residential streets segments in the surrounding area.

Automatic 24-hour traffic counts were conducted in November 2012 on a typical

weekday on the street segment locations listed below. These daily counts were growth-

factored by one percent to represent existing (2013) volumes. The 24-hour automated

traffic count data sheets are contained in Appendix A.

     1. Curson Ave., south of 8th St.
     2. Masselin Ave., south of 8th St.


                                            61
These residential street segments are those most likely to be affected by project traffic.

Per LADOT policy, the determination of significance for a residential street traffic impact

is based on the average daily traffic (ADT) volumes traversing the study street segment.

The incremental project-related increase in daily traffic on a residential street is

considered by LADOT to be significant if it exceeds the criteria in Table 10.

                                      Table 10
                 LADOT Criteria for Significant Local Street Impacts

                Projected Future ADT                Project-Related
                   (With Project)                Increase in Final ADT
                         0 to 999                   120 trips or more
                      1,000 to 1,999               12 percent or more
                      2,000 to 2,999               10 percent or more
                      3,000 or more                 8 percent or more

Existing (2013) Plus Project daily traffic volumes were developed by adding project daily

volumes to Existing (2013) baseline traffic volumes. In order to develop future traffic

volumes on the study residential street segments, the same procedures and

assumptions described previously for the development of future peak-hour intersection

volumes were used. The Future (2016) Without Project daily traffic volume estimates

were based on Existing (2013) daily traffic volumes, plus daily traffic volumes due to

ambient traffic growth and related projects. The Future (2016) With Project daily traffic

volumes include the addition of project daily traffic volumes.          The results of the

residential street impact analysis are summarized in Table 11. As shown in Table 11,

neither of the study street segments would experience an increase in project traffic

volumes resulting in a significant impact under Existing or Future conditions.

where a project could add a total of 50 or more trips during either peak hour.

Additionally, all freeway monitoring locations where a project could add 150 or more

trips in either direction during the peak hours are to be analyzed.

The nearest CMP arterial monitoring locations are the following intersections:

       ·    La Brea Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (approx. 0.5 miles east of the project site)
       ·    La Cienega Blvd./Wilshire Blvd. (approx.. 1.25 miles west)
       ·    Highland Ave./Santa Monica Blvd. (approx. 2.0 miles northeast)
       ·    La Cienega Blvd./Santa Monica Blvd. (approx.. 2.25 miles northwest)

A review of the project trip generation (shown in Table 5) and project only traffic

volumes (shown in Figure 6) shows that the proposed project would be expected to

contribute 50 or more peak-hour trips to only one CMP monitoring intersection: La Brea


                                                   63
Avenue/Wilshire Boulevard.     As shown in the detailed CMA analysis herein, these

project trips would result in a significant project impact under future traffic conditions

during both peak hours. The impact criteria applied in the preceding analysis for this

intersection is also more stringent that those described in the CMP. Potential mitigation

measures recommended for this location are discussed in the following Mitigation

Measures section of the report.

The nearest CMP freeway monitoring segments are as follows:

      ·   Santa Monica Freeway, east of La Brea Avenue (approx. 2.0 miles south of
          the project site)
      ·   Hollywood Freeway, south of Santa Monica Boulevard (approx. 3.25 miles
          northeast)

It is estimated that the proposed project would contribute no more than 23 directional

trips to any freeway segment during either peak hour. As this project contribution is well

below the 150 directional-trip threshold, no significant project impacts to CMP freeway

monitoring locations are forecast and no additional freeway analysis is necessary.

Transit Impact Analysis

The proposed project is estimated to generate 1,388 net vehicle trips per day, including

228 trips during the AM peak hour and 242 trips during the PM peak hour. This trip

generation reflects a vehicle trip reduction of up to 15 percent due to transit usage,

which amounts to 245 daily, 41 AM peak-hour and 42 PM peak-hour trips. No pass-by

or existing use trip reductions have been included.      Per the 2010 CMP guidelines,

person trips can be estimated by multiplying the transit vehicle trip reductions by a

conversion factor of 1.4.    Therefore, the number of proposed project person trips

anticipated to be added to transit is shown below.

        PM Peak Hour              42                   1.4                 59

The most convenient and direct transit route for the proposed project is along Wilshire

Boulevard, which is immediately adjacent to the project site. Except for the LADOT

DASH Fairfax line, no regular transit service is provided along 6th Street, the next

closest arterial to the site. For purposes of a conservative analysis, this transit analysis

assumed that all project transit person trips would be concentrated on Metro bus lines

traveling along Wilshire Boulevard between Fairfax Avenue and La Brea Avenue.

There are two Metro lines on Wilshire Boulevard in this vicinity, Line 20, a local line, and

Line 720, a Metro Rapid line. As Line 20 has stops adjacent to the site and Line 720

does not, the analysis focused solely on Line 20.             This further enhanced the

conservative analysis, as no bus capacity from Line 720 was included.

Information regarding the existing transit usage for Line 20 was obtained from Metro.

This information included daily and peak-period bus boardings and alightings. During

the weekday peak period of 6:00 to 9:00 AM, Line 20 has 37 buses arriving at Curson

Avenue with 685 passengers onboard. During the weekday peak period of 3:00 to 7:00

PM, this line has 46 buses arriving at Curson Avenue with 1,160 passengers onboard.

Thus, there are an average of 18.5 passengers per bus during the AM peak period and

25.2 passengers per bus during the PM peak period.

It is estimated that, at Curson Avenue, the Project would add an average of 4.6

passengers during the AM peak hour and 5.1 passengers during the PM peak hour to


                                            65
Line 20. Together with the current passenger loads, the combined passenger loads

would average 23.1 and 30.3 passengers per bus during the respective AM and PM

peak hours. Based on a typical bus seating capacity of 40 persons, there would still

remain a seating capacity of 24 to 42 percent. Therefore, the addition of Project transit

trips is not expected to result in a significant impact to transit.

                                 MITIGATION MEASURES



As indicated in the preceding traffic analysis, the proposed Museum Square Office

Building project is expected to significantly impact the following study intersections

under future traffic conditions, prior to mitigation:

     6. Fairfax Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
     9. Curson Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (AM peak hour)
    11. Masselin Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
    13. Hauser Blvd./Wilshire Blvd. (PM peak hour)
    19. La Brea Ave./Wilshire Blvd. (AM and PM peak hours)

A series of mitigation measures were investigated to address these significant impacts.

As a first step, mitigation in the form of Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and

Trip Reduction Measures was analyzed. The project will comply with the requirements

of the City of Los Angeles TDM Ordinance (No. 167,700) as a non-residential

development in excess of 100,000 gross square feet in size. In order to determine the

effect of TDM program implementation for the proposed project, it was conservatively

estimated that such a program would result in a five percent decrease in project trips.

With a five-percent reduction, the project trip generation with TDM would be reduced to

217 trips (191 inbound, 26 outbound) during the AM peak hour and 230 trips (39

inbound, 191 outbound) during the PM peak hour. Using these project volumes, a

Future (2016) With Project With Mitigation condition was analyzed, and the results are

shown in Table 13. As shown in the table and described further in this section, impacts

at four of the five intersections would remain significant with a TDM program due to a

lack of feasible physical mitigation. At the intersection of Masselin Avenue and Wilshire

Boulevard, however, the implementation of a TDM program and physical mitigation

measures (described below) would reduce the project impact to a less-than-significant

level.

Given that the implementation of the aforementioned TDM program and its trip

reduction effectiveness alone would not be expected to mitigate the impacts at any of

the five intersections to less-than-significant levels, potential physical mitigation

measures were examined as a second step.                            With the planned improvements on

Wilshire Boulevard as part of the Wilshire BRT project, improvements to the Wilshire

Boulevard eastbound and westbound approaches at these locations were not

considered practical. As described below, comprehensive reviews of the significantly

impacted study locations revealed that, at four of the five intersections, physical

mitigation measures would be infeasible due to potentially significant secondary

impacts.

      Fairfax Ave./Wilshire Blvd.:             Widening and restriping along Fairfax Avenue to
      convert the southbound right-turn-only lane to a shared through/right-turn lane
      would mitigate the project impact to a less-than-significant level. In order to provide
      an additional (third) southbound lane for through movements, this through lane
      would have to extend from several blocks north of Wilshire Boulevard to several
      blocks south of Wilshire Boulevard, resulting in the reconstruction of numerous
      unsignalized and signalized intersections along Fairfax Avenue. Implementation of

                                                         68
this mitigation would also require substantial acquisition of private property and
partial demolition of private buildings. On-street parking spaces would also have to
be removed, with little opportunity for relocation within a convenient walking
distance.   Considering these factors, this mitigation measure is not considered
feasible for this intersection.

Curson Ave./Wilshire Blvd.: Restriping the south leg of Curson Avenue to provide a
northbound right-turn-only lane would mitigate the project impact to a less-than-
significant level. Implementation of this mitigation would require the removal of four
Loading Zone parking spaces located along the east side of Curson Avenue,
immediately south of Wilshire Boulevard, that serve the Wilshire Courtyard
development located at the southeast corner of this intersection. As development-
adjacent Loading Zone parking spaces, their relocation within a convenient walking
distance of the Wilshire Courtyard development would not be practicable.          The
provision of the northbound right-turn-only would also potentially require the
removal of metered parking spaces located along the east side of the Curson
Avenue, further south of Wilshire Boulevard. If the Curson Avenue south leg were
widened to install the northbound right-turn-only lane while retaining the existing
Loading Zone and metered parking spaces, this measure would require a reduction
in sidewalk widths to less than the standard 10 feet for Collector Streets or the
acquisition of private property and partial demolition of private buildings. Such a
reduction in sidewalk widths would be contrary to the City's Walkability Checklist.
Considering these factors, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for this
intersection.

Masselin Ave./Wilshire Blvd.:     Restriping the south leg of Masselin Avenue to
provide an exclusive left-turn lane for the northbound approach would mitigate the
project impact to a less-than-significant level. The sidewalk and curb return at the
northwest corner of the intersection would require minor reconstruction, and the
traffic signal equipment would be modified as necessary. Implementation of this
mitigation could be achieved without the removal of on-street parking spaces along
Masselin Avenue, as shown in the conceptual mitigation plan provided in Appendix
E.   The results of Future (2016) With Project With Mitigation analysis at this
location, assuming the aforementioned TDM program implementation and this
physical improvement, are shown in Table 13.

                                       69
    Hauser Blvd./Wilshire Blvd.: Widening and restriping along Hauser Boulevard to
    provide two northbound through travel lanes along the portion of this roadway
    including the Wilshire Boulevard intersection would mitigate the project impact to a
    less-than-significant level.    With this improvement, the Hauser Boulevard
    northbound approach at this intersection would consist of a left-turn lane, a through
    travel lane, and a shared through/right-turn lane. The two northbound travel lanes
    would continue north of the intersection until 6th Street, where the inside through
    lane would become a "trap" left-turn lane.        In order to provide an additional
    northbound lane for through movements, a substantial amount of on-street parking
    on Hauser Boulevard, north and south of the intersection, would have to be
    removed. Given the quantity of parking spaces that would require removal, their
    relocation within a convenient walking distance would not be practicable. If Hauser
    Boulevard were widened to install the additional northbound through lane while
    retaining the existing on-street parking spaces, this measure would require a
    reduction in sidewalk widths to less than the standard 10 feet for Collector Streets
    or the acquisition of private property and partial demolition of private buildings.
    Such a reduction in sidewalk widths would be contrary to the City's Walkability
    Checklist.      The intersections of Hauser Boulevard and 6th Street and Hauser
    Boulevard and 8th Street would also likely have to be reconstructed. Considering
    these factors, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for this intersection.

    La Brea Ave./Wilshire Blvd.:       Widening and restriping the La Brea Avenue
    southbound approach to provide a right-turn-only lane would mitigate the project
    AM and PM peak-hour impacts to less-than-significant levels.                 With this
    improvement, the La Brea Avenue southbound approach at this intersection would
    consist of a left-turn lane, three through travel lanes, and a right-turn-only lane.
    Implementation of this mitigation would require the acquisition of private property at
    the northwest corner of the intersection and partial demolition of private buildings.
    Considering these factors, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for this
    intersection.

Therefore, the project impacts at four of the five abovementioned study intersections

would remain significant and unavoidable.

          RE:       Proposed Museum Square Office Building at 5757 Wilshire Boulevard
                    Supplemental Intersection Analysis


Dear Wes,

Based on comments received from the public during the Notice of Preparation (NOP) public
scoping meeting held on May 22, 2013 for the proposed Museum Square Office Building project
(the "Project"), Crain & Associates has conducted a supplemental traffic impact analysis at the
intersection of Martel Avenue-Hauser Boulevard/3rd Street. A member of the public noted that
the Martel Avenue-Hauser Boulevard corridor is a popular north-south route for motorists
between Fairfax Avenue and La Brea Avenue and specifically requested the addition of this
intersection to the Project study area. The traffic impact study for the Project, submitted to the
City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) in March 2013 and approved on
July 1, 2013, included an analysis of 23 study intersections and two residential street segments.
Thus, the supplemental analysis herein represents the 24th study intersection for the Project.

The supplemental analysis at the intersection of Martel Avenue-Hauser Boulevard/3rd Street has
been performed using the same analysis procedures as those in the Project traffic impact study.
Traffic volumes for existing conditions at this location were obtained from a manual traffic count
conducted on Tuesday, June 4, 2013. The intersection traffic count data sheets are provided in
Attachment A, and the Existing (2013) AM and PM peak-hour volumes are depicted in
Attachment B.



                                                                         300 Corporate Pointe

                                                                         Culver City, CA  90230 
                                                                         310 473 6508 (main)

                                                                         www.crainandassociates.com

The Project trip generation characteristics were determined previously in the traffic impact
study. The distribution and assignment of Project trips have been expanded through the
intersection of Martel Avenue-Hauser Boulevard/3rd Street. Applying the inbound and
outbound percentages to the Project trip generation, the Project only traffic volumes at this
intersection were determined. The Existing (2013) Plus Project traffic volumes were then
determined by superimposing the Project only traffic volumes onto the Existing (2013) traffic
volumes. Figures showing the Project trip distribution percentages, Project only traffic volumes
and Existing (2013) Plus Project traffic volumes at the study intersection are included in
Attachment B.

The future traffic conditions were developed in the same manner as described in the traffic
impact study. An ambient growth factor of 1.0 percent per year was applied to the Existing
(2013) traffic volumes to develop future (2016) baseline traffic volumes. Traffic volumes
expected to be generated by "related projects" were then added to these future baseline traffic
volumes to form the Future (2016) Without Project traffic volumes. The Project only traffic
volumes were added to the Future (2016) Without Project traffic volumes to generate the Future
(2016) With Project traffic volumes. Figures illustrating the total related project, Future (2016)
Without Project and Future (2016) With Project traffic volumes are included in Attachment B.

The results of the analysis of existing and future traffic conditions at the supplemental study
intersection are summarized in the CMA/LOS calculation worksheets in Attachment C. As
shown in Attachment C, the addition of project-related traffic to this intersection would not
deteriorate the LOS under existing or future conditions. Under Existing (2013) and Existing
(2013) Plus Project conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS C during both the AM and
PM peak hours. Under Future (2016) Without Project and Future (2016) With Project
conditions, the intersection would operate at LOS C during the AM peak hour and at LOS D
during the PM peak hour. Based on the LADOT criteria for significant intersection traffic
impacts, no significant impacts are expected to result due to the Project under Existing or Future
conditions. Therefore, no mitigation measures are required at this location.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

                                              Sincerely,

                         MUSEUM SQUARE OFFICE PROJECT
                       CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC IMPACTS, DEIR



Project construction is anticipated to begin shortly after project approvals are granted, with
estimated completion approximately mid-2016. There would be four basic construction phases
with an approximate duration of 24 months. These phases are expected to be consecutive, as
shown in the estimated schedule below.

    Phase 1     Demolition                                    1 month
    Phase 2     Site / Foundation Preparation                 6 months
    Phase 3     Building Framing                              8 months
    Phase 4     Finishing                                     9 months
                                                             24 months

The proposed construction hours would be within the period of 7:00 AM - 9:00 PM, Monday -
Friday, and 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM, Saturday, as permitted by City building and noise regulations.
Construction activity on Saturday would generally be less intense compared to weekday activity.
Some Saturdays would likely have minimal construction activity.

Construction Traffic Impacts

Project construction would generate traffic from construction worker travel, trucks hauling debris
generated by on-site demolition activities, trucks delivering construction materials, and minor,
miscellaneous activities. Both the number of construction workers and trucks would vary
throughout the construction process in order to maintain a reasonable schedule of completion.

Construction Worker Trips

Construction workers would not be allowed to park on public streets in the surrounding area.
Construction worker parking would be accommodated in the existing on-site parking structure.
Construction workers would also be able to park in the project's additional on-site parking levels
after they have been completed. Should these parking facilities be insufficient, arrangements
would be made for construction worker parking in other nearby parking facilities, along with
supplemental shuttle service as necessary.

It is estimated that the number of construction workers (including management supervisors)
would average approximately 105 persons the majority of the time. In general, it is anticipated
that the large majority of these workers would arrive at and depart the site during off-peak hours;
i.e., arrive prior to 7:00 AM, before the beginning of the heaviest morning commute period, and
depart prior to 4:00 PM, before the beginning of the heaviest afternoon commute period. The
work force would likely be from all parts of the Los Angeles region and, therefore, has been
assumed to arrive from all directions. Consequently, the impact of construction worker traffic on
peak-hour traffic in the vicinity of the site would be minimal. Given the off-peak nature of
construction worker traffic, a less than significant impact is anticipated with regard to the street
and freeway systems.

Construction Truck Trips

Construction trucks would not be allowed to stage on public streets. They would also not be
allowed to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or block access to nearby residences and
businesses.

Depending on the specific nature of the construction activity, it is assumed that the majority of
truck traffic would be distributed evenly across the workday. It is conservatively estimated that
up to approximately 5,000 cubic yards of demolished materials would be transported from the
project site by haul trucks. It is anticipated that hauling would be limited to the weekday six-
hour period of 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM, and that during peak hauling operations, there would be up to
20 truckloads per day of demolished materials being transported off-site. This would amount to
3.3 inbound and 3.3 outbound haul truck trips per hour. Assuming a passenger car equivalence
(PCE) factor of 2.5, these haul truck trips would be equivalent to approximately 8 inbound and 8
outbound passenger car trips per hour.

At this time, it is indeterminate as to the location of the site that would be receiving the
demolished materials and, therefore, it is indeterminate as to the specific route that would be
likely be used by the haul trucks. The project would be required to obtain approval of a Haul
Route Permit by the City's Department of Building and Safety, which would specify the
destination site and the route requirements for the haul trucks. It is anticipated that the route for
the haul trucks would be oriented toward major arterials and freeways as much as feasible.

For purposes of providing an estimate of haul truck impacts, it is assumed that a haul route
candidate would consist of Curson Avenue, Masselin Avenue, 6th Street, Wilshire Boulevard,
and La Brea Avenue to and from the I-10 Freeway. Departing the project site, it is anticipated
that haul trucks would turn right onto Curson Avenue, turn right onto 6th Street, turn right onto
Masselin Avenue, turn left onto Wilshire Boulevard and travel eastbound to La Brea Avenue,
and turn right onto La Brea Avenue and travel southbound to the I-10 Freeway. Returning to the
site, it is anticipated that haul trucks would travel northbound on La Brea Avenue from the I-10
Freeway to Wilshire Boulevard, turn left onto Wilshire Boulevard and travel westbound, and



                                                  2
turn right onto Curson Avenue. This routing pattern would minimize left turns by the haul
trucks, which would lessen delay to the haul trucks and overall traffic. Assuming a haul truck
peak generation of 8inbound and 8 outbound PCE trips per hour, it is estimated the haul truck
impacts at the six study intersections along the candidate haul route would be as follows:

As shown in Table __, and based on the City's significant intersection impact criteria, the traffic
impacts of the haul trucks would be less than significant.

Trucks would also be delivering construction materials to the project site. It is assumed that
weekday deliveries would be restricted to the 11-hour period of 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM. It is
estimated that the number of truck deliveries would average 30 per day the majority of the time,
with up to 50 deliveries per day on peak occasions. At peak times, there would be approximately
4.5 inbound and 4.5 outbound delivery truck trips per hour. Applying the PCE factor of 2.5,
these trips would be equivalent to approximately 11 inbound and 11 outbound passenger car trips
per hour. Extrapolating the impact results of the preceding haul truck analysis, and assuming
that the delivery trucks would travel the same route, it is estimated that the impacts of the
delivery trucks at the six study intersections would also be less than significant. If the delivery
trucks access the project site via more than one route, their trips would be more dispersed, further
reducing the potential for significant impacts.

                                                 3
While there may be occasions when haul truck and delivery truck activities would be concurrent,
those occasions would be minimal and sporadic, and would be managed to balance truck flow
into and out of the project site, and to minimize disruptions to the street system.

Miscellaneous Trips

In addition to the trips generated by construction workers and trucks, a nominal amount of
miscellaneous trips would be generated by visitors, vendors, inspectors, small delivery vehicles
(e.g., UPS and Federal Express), and lunch vans. It is anticipated that these miscellaneous trips
would typically average 20 inbound and 20 outbound trips per day, and would generally occur
during off-peak traffic hours and have no significant impact.

Emergency Access

Short-term, construction activities, such as lane closures, sidewalk closures and utility line
construction, could have implications with regard to response times for emergency vehicles.
Other implications of construction include reduced travel time due to flagging or stopping of
traffic to accommodate trucks entering and exiting the site.

Construction access and activities would be primarily located on Curson Avenue, a Collector
Street between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street. It is not anticipated that the construction
activities would impede any pass-through emergency vehicles or other traffic, as one travel lane
in each direction on Curson Avenue would be maintained at all times. There would be no street
closures, and access to the project site and nearby uses would be provided at all times. Since no
blockage or significant slowing of emergency vehicles is anticipated, the construction activities
would constitute a less than significant impact relative to emergency access. Furthermore, traffic
management personnel (flag persons) would be trained to assist in emergency response by
restricting or controlling the movement of traffic that could interfere with emergency vehicle
access. With coordination between project construction managers and the agencies providing
emergency service, the potential impact of construction on emergency access would be reduced
to a less than significant level.

Other Impacts

There would be no striping changes to Curson Avenue to allow storage of construction
equipment and materials on the street, as all such items would be stored on-site.

Construction fencing would be installed along most of the project perimeter. It is possible that
the sidewalk on the east side of Curson Avenue between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street
would be closed. In that case, pedestrians would be directed to use the sidewalk on the west side

                                                4
of Curson Avenue, which would be facilitated by the signals and crosswalks at the intersections
of Wilshire Boulevard and Curson Avenue, and 6th Street and Curson Avenue.

Construction Design Features

Although no significant construction traffic impacts are anticipated, the following design features
are recommended during project construction to maintain pedestrian and vehicular safety, and to
avoid substantial inconvenience to pedestrians, motorists, transit service, residents, businesses
and driveway access proximate to the project site.

o   A Construction Staging and Traffic Management Plan (CSTMP) shall be prepared for
    approval by LADOT and other appropriate agencies, and implemented during project
    construction. The CSTMP shall describe the traffic control measures and devices to be
    implemented for the various construction phases, along with any sidewalk closures, traffic
    lane closures, temporary walkway installations, K-rail installations, temporary traffic lane
    modifications, temporary signal modifications, etc. The CSTMP shall also include the name
    and phone number of a construction project manager who can be reached 24 hours a day
    regarding construction complaints or emergency situations. In addition, the CSTMP shall
    take into account and be coordinated with other construction traffic management plans that
    may be in effect or have been proposed for other projects in the vicinity.

o   In the event that any portion of the sidewalk along the east side of Curson Avenue between
    Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street is closed due to project construction, appropriate signage
    shall be installed directing pedestrians to use the sidewalk along the west side of Curson
    Avenue, and to cross Curson Avenue at the signalized intersections with Wilshire Boulevard
    and 6th Street.

o   Construction vehicles, including construction worker vehicles, shall not park on public
    streets within one-half mile of the project site.

o   Construction vehicles shall not stage on public streets, or stage or queue where they interfere
    with pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or block access to nearby residences or businesses.

o   One northbound and one southbound travel lane on Curson Avenue between Wilshire
    Boulevard and 6th Street shall be maintained at all times.

o   An adequate number of flag persons in adequate number shall be provided to minimize
    impacts to traffic flow, and to ensure safe access into and out of the project site.



                                                5
o   To the extent feasible, the delivery of construction materials shall be scheduled during off-
    peak traffic periods.

o   Heavy-duty construction vehicles, except haul trucks, shall arrive at the project site no
    sooner than 7:00 AM and depart no later than 6:00 PM.

o   The hours, operation and route for haul trucks shall be determined and approved by the
    City's Department of Building and Safety.

             WESTSIDE SUBWAY EXTENSION (PURPLE LINE) PROJECT
                 CONSTRUCTION TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS



The Westside Subway Extension Project (the "subway project") includes two stations within
approximately 0.4 to 0.5 miles of the proposed project. The two stations, Wilshire/La Brea and
Wilshire/Fairfax, are to be constructed during Phase 1 of the subway project. Based on current
information on the Metro website, as of summer 2013, construction of Phase 1 is scheduled to
begin sometime in 2014 and be completed sometime in 2023. Construction-related
transportation impacts for the Wilshire/La Brea and Wilshire/Fairfax Stations, as well as the
other stations, were discussed and evaluated in Section 3.8 of the Final EIS/EIR for the subway
project.

Section 3.8.2 discussed the traffic- and circulation-related impacts resulting from this
construction. These impacts would be associated with contractor work and storage areas;
stations; crossovers; mining entry/exit locations; tunnel boring machine operations and support
activities; truck haul routes; transportation of oversized construction materials; station entrances;
station appendages; grout injection; and drop holes. This section specifically evaluated impacts
due to the following:

    o     Truck Haul Routes (location, length, overlaps, truck trips, and land uses)
    o     Traffic Handling (traffic lane requirements, temporary street closures and detour
          routes, construction-related effects on emergency vehicle access, and access and
          impacts on commercial driveways)

Section 3.8.3 of the Final EIS/EIR evaluated construction-related impacts/consequences related
to public transit.

Section 3.8.4 of the Final EIS/EIR evaluated construction-related impacts/consequences related
to parking. It may be necessary to prohibit on-street parking when traffic lanes are closed or
temporarily eliminated. Existing on-street parking and loading zones will be temporarily
removed for the duration of construction. Parking meters within traffic control zones and
affected by construction will be removed or covered, as directed by the agency having
jurisdiction.

Section 3.8.5 of the Final EIS/EIR evaluated construction-related impacts/consequences related
to pedestrian and bicycle access.
The Final EIS/EIR determined that transportation impacts due to the subway construction would
significant and unavoidable where they result in substantial increase in traffic delay or
degradation in levels of service for traffic operation or alternatives modes. Measures to mitigate
these impacts, which are fully described in Section 3.8.6 of the Final EIS/EIR, include the
following:

    o     Traffic and Circulation Mitigation Measures
                Traffic Control Plans
                Designated Haul Routes
                Emergency Vehicle Access
                Transportation Management Plan
                Coordination with Planned Roadway Improvements
    o     Public Transit Mitigation Measures
               Temporary Bus Stops and route Diversions
    o     Parking Mitigation Measures
               Parking Management Program
               Parking Monitoring and Community Outreach
               Construction
               Worker Parking
    o     Pedestrian and Bicycle Mitigation Measures
               Pedestrian Routes and Access
               Bicycle Paths and Access

With the implementation of the above mitigation measures, the Final EIS/EIR concluded that the
adverse transportation effects related to the subway construction would be reduced for adjacent
commercial and residential neighborhoods. Although the majority of the construction impacts
on traffic and circulation, transit, pedestrians, and bicycles would be temporary, impacts and/or
residual impacts after mitigation would remain significant and unavoidable during the
construction period.

Concurrent Project Construction

The Proposed Project is of much smaller scale than the subway project and will be completed
within a much shorter time frame. As previously discussed and analyzed, the Proposed Project's
construction-related impacts would be less than significant. It is possible that the construction
periods for Metro Rail and Rail and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures ("AAMP")
project could overlap with the construction of the Proposed Project. In the event of concurrent
construction activity involving the AAMP project, Metro Rail project and Proposed Project,
cumulative traffic impacts would be significant and unavoidable during the construction period

                                                2
as described in the Metro Rail EIS/EIR and the Proposed Project would contribute incrementally
to this impact. Traffic conditions and facilities in the vicinity of Wilshire Boulevard, La Brea
Avenue, Fairfax Avenue and other nearby streets would be cumulatively and more severely
impacted during periods when these construction activities are concurrent. To avoid substantial
inconvenience and disruption as much as feasible, the Construction Staging and Traffic
Management Plan, as described earlier under "Construction Design Features" for the Proposed
Project, as well as a similar plan that would be required for the AAMP project by the City, will
take into account and be coordinated with other construction traffic management plans in the
vicinity. In addition, Metro will implement the measures outlined in the Final EIS/EIR to
minimize impacts during the construction of the subway project. However, even with
implementation of the maximum feasible implementation of mitigation measures, cumulative
construction traffic impacts would be temporarily significant and unavoidable in the event of
concurrent construction of these three projects.
