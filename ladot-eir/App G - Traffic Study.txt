October 2013




1. Introduction

Fehr & Peers conducted a traffic study to evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the proposed Gaffey
Pool project, located within Angels Gate Park at 3351 Gaffey Street in the San Pedro community of Los
Angeles, California. This report identifies the base data and assumptions, explains the methodologies
used, and summarizes the findings of the study. The traffic impact analysis conducted for this report
includes analysis of existing (2013) conditions and opening year (2016) conditions.

Project Description

The Gaffey Street Pool was originally constructed in 1943. The proposed project would restore and re-
open the pool to public use as one of the seasonal pools operated by the City's Department of Recreation
and Parks. It would be used by all ages for activities such as lap swimming, water aerobics, aquatic
lessons, recreation swimming, team practice and synchronized swimming performance. The concrete
seating area and changing rooms will be upgraded to meet standard bathhouse requirements. The main
parking area for the facility will be west of the existing pool. Vehicular traffic will use Gaffey Street to reach
                               th
Leavenworth Drive (near 36 Street), currently the entrance to Angels Gate Park and Fort MacArthur
                                                                                          nd
Museum. The pool will also be accessible from Osgood Farley Road (opposite 32 Street). The pool will
be open from June to September. Approximate hours of operation would be weekdays from 11:00 AM to
6:00 PM on weekdays and noon to 6:00 PM on weekend days. Access from the lower slope area on
                      rd
Gaffey Street near 33 Street will include stair access and a handicapped accessible ramp. Historically a
stairway connected the pool with the neighborhood at the foot of the slope, and a crosswalk on Gaffey
                          rd
Street was present at 33 Street to facilitate pedestrian crossings. The conceptual site plan is illustrated in
Figure 1.

Study Scope

The scope of work for this study was developed in conjunction with the Los Angeles Department of
Transportation (LADOT). The base assumptions and technical methodologies were discussed as part of
the study approach. The study analyzes potential project-generated traffic impacts on the adjacent street
system for existing conditions and the opening year. The following traffic scenarios were analyzed for the
weekday PM peak hour (between 3:00 and 6:00 PM):

    ·   Existing (Year 2013) Conditions ­ The analysis of existing Year 2013 traffic conditions provides a
        basis for the remainder of the study. The existing conditions analysis includes an assessment of
        streets, traffic volumes, and operating conditions. The existing traffic conditions are the baseline for
        assessing the significance of project impacts.

    ·   Existing (Year 2013) plus Project Conditions ­ This is an analysis of existing traffic conditions with
        traffic expected from the proposed project added to the traffic volumes.

    ·    Opening Year (Year 2016) Conditions ­ Future traffic conditions are projected without the proposed
         project in the opening year 2016. The objective of this phase of analysis is to project future traffic
         growth and operating conditions that could be expected to result from regional ambient growth
         and known cumulative projects if the proposed project were not developed. The cumulative base
         traffic forecasts are used to develop cumulative baseline operating conditions that provide the basis
         for determining project impacts.

    ·    Cumulative Year (2016) plus Project Conditions ­ This is an analysis of future traffic conditions with
         traffic expected from the proposed project added to the cumulative base traffic forecasts.
         Cumulative plus proposed project conditions were developed for years 2016. The objective of this
         analysis is to develop the traffic forecasts of the proposed project that are then used to identify
         potential impacts.

The traffic study focuses on the weekday PM peak hour of traffic because it represents the worst overall
traffic conditions when the project will be open, and thus has the greatest potential for impact.

As illustrated in Figure 2, two intersections were identified, in consultation with LADOT, for weekday
afternoon peak hour analysis as part of the scope of work for this project.

Organization of Report

This report is divided into six chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 describes the existing
conditions in the study area including an inventory of the streets, highways, and transit service in the
study area, a summary of traffic volumes and an assessment of operating conditions. The methodologies
used to develop traffic forecasts for the cumulative base and cumulative plus project and the forecasts
themselves are included in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents an assessment of potential intersection traffic
impacts generated by the proposed project. The results of the regional transportation system analysis are
provided in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 summarizes the key findings and conclusions of the study. Appendices
to this report include details of the technical analysis.

2. Existing Conditions

This chapter presents a description of existing roadways and traffic conditions in the study area. The
assessment of conditions relevant to this study includes an inventory of the street and highway systems,
traffic volumes on these facilities, and operating conditions at key intersections. A detailed description of
these elements in presented in this chapter.

Existing Highway and Street System

The project site is in the San Pedro community of the City of Los Angeles. Primary regional access to the
project area is provided by the Harbor Freeway (I-110), which terminates at Gaffey Street approximately
four miles north of the project site. Local access to the project site is provided by a well-defined grid of
arterial and collector roads. The primary roadway facilities in the project study area are:

    ·   Gaffey Street ­ Gaffey Street is classified as a Major Class II Highway that runs north/south in the
        study area. In the vicinity of the project site it provides two travel lanes and provides a connection
        for local and regional travel from southern San Pedro to other parts of Los Angeles. Gaffey Street in

    ·   Metro Line 246 ­ Metro Line 246 travels between the Harbor Gateway Transit Center and southern
        San Pedro (Paseo del Mar & Almeria Street), generally along Avalon Boulevard, John S. Gibson
        Boulevard, Pacific Avenue and Paseo del Mar. This line provides service from approximately 6:00
        AM to 7:00 PM seven days a week, with headways of approximately 30 to 60 minutes.

Existing Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service

This section presents the existing peak hour turning movement traffic volumes for the analyzed
intersections, describes the methodology used to assess the traffic conditions at each intersection, and
analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each, indicating volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios and level of
service (LOS).

Existing Traffic Volumes

New traffic counts were conducted for the weekday afternoon peak period (between 3:00 and 6:00 PM) in
June 2013 while school was in normal session. The existing weekday afternoon peak hour traffic volumes
at the analyzed intersections are presented in Appendix B. Traffic count data sheets are provided in
Appendix A.

Level of Service Methodology

LOS is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow, ranging from excellent "free-
flow" conditions at LOS A to overloaded "stop-and-go" conditions at LOS F. LOS D is typically considered
to be the minimum desirable level of service in urban areas.

According to Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (LADOT, June 2013), this study is required to use the
Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) method of intersection capacity calculation (Transportation Research
Circular No. 212, Transportation Research Board, 1980) to analyze the LOS at signalized intersections,
                                              nd
including the signalized intersection of 32 Street/Barlow Saxton Road & Gaffey Street. The CMA
methodology determines the V/C ratio of an intersection based on the number of approach lanes, the
traffic signal phasing and the traffic volumes. The signalized study intersection is by the City's Automated
Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system and, in accordance with LADOT procedures, a capacity
increase of 7% was applied to reflect the benefits of ATSAC. The CMA worksheet developed by LADOT
was used to implement the CMA methodology in this study. The V/C ratio is then used to find the
corresponding LOS based on the definitions in Table 1.

The "Two-Way Stop-Controlled" methodology from Highway Capacity Manual was used to determine the
                                                                                                     th
average vehicle control delay (in seconds) for the two-way stop-controlled study intersection 36
Street/Leavenworth Drive & Gaffey Street. The two-way stop-controlled methodology relates intersection
LOS to the delay experienced by the most constrained approach (i.e., either the northbound or
southbound left turns or the eastbound or westbound approaches), rather than to the intersection as a
whole. The corresponding levels of service are defined by the list in Table 2.

                                                fully utilized; many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                                                restricted within groups of vehicles.

           C                  0.701-0.800       GOOD. Occasionally drivers may have to wait
                                                through more than one red light; backups may
                                                develop behind turning vehicles.

           D                  0.801-0.900       FAIR. Delays may be substantial during portions

Existing Peak Hour Levels of Service

The existing weekday peak hour turning movement volumes presented in Appendix B were used in
conjunction with the LOS methodology described above to determine existing operating conditions at
each of the study intersections. LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix C.

Table 3 summarizes the existing weekday afternoon peak hour V/C ratio and delay and corresponding
LOS at the study intersections. The results of this analysis indicate that both of the two intersections are
currently operating at good levels of service (LOS A) in the afternoon peak hour.

October 2013




3. Traffic Projections

Project Traffic Volumes

Development of traffic estimates for the proposed project involved a three-step process including traffic
generation, trip distribution, and traffic assignment.

Project Traffic Generation

The number of person trips generated was estimated based on the expected use of the pool, including
the types of programs and number of users. Information was provided by the City of Los Angeles
Department of Recreation and Parks on the actual level of utilization at Westchester Pool (the most
comparably-located seasonal pools, as they both lie within the coastal zone) and Peck Pool (the nearest
City pool to the Gaffey Pool). In 2012, July was the busiest month at both existing pool, with an average
of approximately 150-200 persons per day. Average daily attendance in August at Westchester Pool and
Peck Pool was approximately 120-140 persons. The Gaffey Pool would be used by all ages for activities
such as swim lessons, diving lessons, recreational swimming, synchronized swimming, water polo and
junior lifeguard training. Total peak daily attendance at the Gaffey Pool was estimated at twice the
average attendance at Westchester Pool during the busiest month, July.

The vehicular trip generation estimate was derived from the number of person trips and an assumed
average vehicle occupancy of 2.0 persons per vehicle, based on observations at the Westchester Pool.
Some pool users will travel by bicycle or walk in from the surrounding neighborhood. The proposed
stairway and handicapped access ramp would provide the most direct route for pedestrians to reach the
pool. The swim facility-generated vehicular traffic was used to develop a peak hour for analysis of the
afternoon peak hour of adjacent street traffic. Since vehicular trips generated on a weekend typically do
not create a significant impact, only weekday volumes were analyzed. The Gaffey Pool will be open from
June through September (Labor Day or shortly after), which overlaps somewhat with the normal academic
year for public schools in this area. To provide a conservative analysis of potential traffic impacts, the
traffic analysis combines the estimated trip generation of the Gaffey Pool during its peak month (July) and
the weekday background traffic levels during the normal school year.

As shown in Table 4, the project is projected to generate a total of approximately 364 vehicle trips on a
peak summer weekday, including approximately 70 trips during the PM peak hour (35 inbound, 35
outbound).

Project Traffic Distribution

The geographic distribution of trips generated by the proposed project is dependent on characteristics of
the street system serving the site, the level of accessibility of routes to and from the proposed project site,
and the geographic distribution of population from which swimmers would be drawn. The trip
distribution pattern used in this study was developed in consultation with LADOT and is based in part on
the population density illustrated in Figure 3. This includes the following trip distribution by cardinal
directions:

Project Traffic Assignment

The trip generation estimates summarized in Table 4 and the distribution pattern described above were
used to assign the project-generated traffic to the study intersections. Estimated project-generated
afternoon peak hour traffic volumes at the analyzed intersections during a typical weekday are illustrated
in Appendix B.

Existing plus Project Traffic Projections

The proposed project traffic volumes were added to the 2013 baseline traffic counts to develop the
Existing plus Project traffic volumes. Appendix B illustrates the resulting projected Existing plus Project
peak hour traffic volumes for a typical weekday PM peak hour.

Future Base Traffic Volumes

The future base traffic projections reflect the changes to existing traffic conditions that can be expected
from three primary sources. The first source is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects increases in
traffic because of regional growth and development. The second source is traffic generated by specific
development projects located within, or in the vicinity of, the study area. The third source is roadway or
intersection capacity enhancements. These factors are described below.

Areawide Traffic Growth

Based on discussions with LADOT, it was determined that an ambient growth factor of 1.0% per year
should be applied to adjust the existing base year traffic volumes to reflect the effects of regional growth
and development for the 2016 project opening year. This adjustment was applied to the base Year 2013
traffic volume data to reflect the effect of ambient growth of 3.0% in Year 2016.

Related Project Traffic Generation and Assignment

Future base traffic forecasts include the effects of specific cumulative development projects, also called
related projects, expected to be built in the vicinity of the proposed project site prior to the proposed
project's future year of 2016. Following coordination with the Los Angeles Departments of Transportation
and City Planning, one related project was identified in the vicinity of the study area.

The related project is City Dock #1 project, located at Berths 56-60 and 70-71.within the Port of Los
Angeles, approximately 1.5 miles from the project site. In 2016, that project is forecast to generate a total
of 1,046 daily trips, including 96 in the PM peak hour (22 inbound, 74 outbound). A review of the trip
assignment in the traffic study for that project shows that three southbound trips and one northbound




                                                                                                          14

trip were estimated to travel on Gaffey Street near the site of the proposed Gaffey Pool. These volumes
were added to the Existing volumes after calculating ambient growth through 2016.

Future Baseline Street Improvements

There are currently no planned street improvements at the study locations that are scheduled to be in
place by 2016.

Traffic Assignment

Using the estimated trip generation and trip distribution patterns described above, traffic generated by
the related projects was assigned to the street network.

Future Base and Future Base plus Project Traffic Projections

Appendix B illustrates the future base for the Year 2016 at the analyzed intersections for weekday
afternoon peak hour. The future base traffic conditions represent an estimate of future conditions
without development of the proposed project.

The proposed project traffic volumes were then added to the future base traffic projections to develop the
future plus project traffic forecasts for the opening year 2016 scenario. These volumes are illustrated in
Appendix B.

4. Level of Service and Significant Impact Analysis

This section presents an analysis of the existing and future, without and with project volumes to
determine the potential traffic impacts of the proposed project on the operating conditions of the
surrounding street system. The traffic impact analysis compares the projected LOS at each study
intersection under Existing and Future plus Project conditions to the Existing and Future Base conditions
to estimate the incremental increase in the V/C ratio caused by the proposed project. This provides the
information needed to assess the potential impact of the project using significance criteria established by
LADOT. Detailed LOS calculations for the proposed project for Existing plus Project and future year 2016
are included in Appendix C.

Criteria for Determination of Significant Traffic Impact

All study intersections are in the City of Los Angeles. Significance criteria established by the City of Los
Angeles was used to assess the potential for significant project impacts at the study intersections.

The City of Los Angeles has established threshold criteria to determine significant traffic impact of a
proposed project in its jurisdiction. Under the LADOT guidelines, an intersection would be significantly
impacted with an increase in V/C ratio equal to or greater than 0.04, or an increase of 6.0 seconds in delay
for intersections projected to operate at LOS C after the addition of project traffic. Stricter thresholds of
significance apply to intersections projected to operate at LOS D, E or F after the addition of project
traffic. Intersections operating at LOS A or B after the addition of the project traffic are not considered
significantly impacted regardless of the project related increase in V/C ratio or delay. The following
summarizes the impact criteria:

                  LOS               Final V/C Ratio        Project-related Increase in V/C
                   C                >0.700 - 0.800         equal to or greater than 0.040
                   D                >0.800 - 0.900         equal to or greater than 0.020
                   E or F           >0.900                 equal to or greater than 0.010

                  LOS               Final Delay            Project-related Increase in V/C
                   C                >20 - 35               equal to or greater than 6.0 seconds
                   D                >35 - 55               equal to or greater than 4.0 seconds
                   E                >55 - 80               equal to or greater than 2.5 seconds
                   F                >80                    equal to or greater than 2.5 seconds

The results of the Existing plus Project analysis are presented in Table 3. As indicated in the table, the two
intersections are projected to continue operating at good levels of service during the PM peak hour.

Project Intersection Impacts ­ Existing plus Project

To determine whether significant impacts would occur at the study intersections, the Existing plus Project
operating conditions were compared to the existing operating conditions. As shown in Table 3, using the
City of Los Angeles criteria for determination of significant impacts, under Existing plus Project conditions,
the proposed project would not result in any significant impacts.

Future Base (Year 2016) Traffic Conditions

The 2016 cumulative and cumulative plus project peak hour traffic volumes illustrated in Appendix B were
analyzed to determine the projected future operating conditions without and with the addition of the
proposed project traffic. As indicated in Table 5, both study intersections are projected to continue
operating at good levels of service during the PM peak hour.

Project Intersection Impacts Year 2016

To determine whether significant impacts would occur at the study intersections, the 2016 plus project
operating conditions were compared to the 2016 base operating conditions. As shown in Table 5, using
the City of Los Angeles criteria for determination of significant impacts, the proposed project would not
result in any significant impacts.

Intersection Mitigation Measures

The aforementioned traffic impact analysis determined that the proposed project will not result in any
significant traffic impacts. As such, no mitigation measures are needed.

 5. Congestion Management Program Analysis

This chapter presents the regional transportation system impact analysis conducted in accordance with
the procedures outlined in 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (Metro,
October 2010).

Regional Traffic Impact Analysis

The CMP guidelines require that the first issue to be addressed is the determination of the geographic
scope of the study area. The criteria for determining the study area for CMP arterial monitoring
intersections and for freeway monitoring locations are:

    ·   All CMP arterial monitoring intersections where the proposed project will add 50 or more trips
        during either the AM or PM peak hours of adjacent street traffic.

    ·   All CMP mainline freeway monitoring locations where the proposed project will add 150 or more
        trips, in either direction, during either the AM or PM peak hours.

The CMP traffic impact analysis guidelines establish that a significant project impact occurs when the
following threshold is exceeded:

    ·   The proposed project increases traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C 0.02),
        causing LOS F (V/C > 1.00).

    ·   If the facility is already at LOS F, a significant impact occurs when the proposed project increases
        traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C 0.02).

Arterial Monitoring Station Analysis

The CMP arterial monitoring stations nearest to the project study area include:

    ·   Gaffey Street & Ninth Street
    ·   Western Avenue & Ninth Street

According to the incremental project trip generation estimates developed in Chapter 3 and the project
only traffic volumes illustrated in Appendix B, the proposed project is not expected to add sufficient new
traffic to exceed the analysis criteria at these locations. No further analysis of CMP arterial intersections is
required and CMP arterial intersection impacts are considered to be less than significant.

Freeway Mainline Monitoring Station Analysis

This section presents an analysis of potential project impacts on the regional transportation system. This
analysis was conducted in accordance with the transportation impact analysis procedures outlined in the
CMP. The CMP mainline freeway monitoring location nearest to the project site is I-110 at C Street.




                                                                                                             19
Traffic Study for the Gaffey Pool
October 2013




The project's total estimated trip generation is less than 150 trips in any peak hour, thus the project would
add fewer than 150 vehicle trips through these arterial monitoring stations. No further analysis of CMP
arterial intersections is required and CMP arterial intersection impacts are considered to be less than
significant.

Regional Transit Impact Analysis

Potential increases in transit person trips generated by the proposed project were estimated as follows.
Section B.8.4 of the CMP provides a methodology for estimating the number of transit trips expected to
result from a proposed project based on the projected number of vehicle trips. The CMP requires that the
transit impact analysis include local services within ¼ mile of the project and express bus and rail routes
within two miles of the project. Potential increases in transit person trips generated by the proposed
project were evaluated based on the CMP methodology. This methodology assumes an Average Vehicle
Ridership (AVR) factor of 1.4 to estimate the number of person trips to and from the project and then
provides guidance regarding the percent of person trips assigned to public transit depending on the type
of use (commercial/other; residential) and its proximity to transit services.

There is one fixed-route transit line (Metro 246) within ¼ mile of the project area. Assuming an average
bus seating capacity of 30 to 40 seats, the total number of seats during peak hours can range from 60 to
80.

The proposed project could generate as many as 70 trips during a weekday PM peak hour. Multiplying
the weekday PM peak hour trips by an AVR of 1.4 estimates that the proposed project could generate a
total of 98 person trips.

Based on parameters in the CMP, a factor of 3.5% was applied to person trips generated to estimate
transit trips. The project may therefore generate approximately four or fewer transit trips in the peak
hour.

The CMP does not have a threshold for determining the significance of impacts on the transit system,
however, at these levels, project-related impacts on the regional transit system would not be considered
significant.




                                                                                                          20

October 2013




6. Summary and Conclusions

This study was undertaken to analyze the potential for traffic impacts resulting from the proposed
improvements to the existing Gaffey Pool in the San Pedro community of Los Angeles, California. The key
findings and conclusions of the study are summarized below:


    ·   The proposed project would restore an existing outdoor swimming pool and re-open it for public
        use as one of the seasonal pools operated by the Department of Recreation and Parks from June
        to September. Improvements would also be made to the concrete seating area and changing
        rooms. Parking would be provided west of the existing pool.

    ·   Vehicular traffic will reach the site primarily from Gaffey Street and Leavenworth Drive or Osgood
        Farley Road. Access will also be available from Alma Street west of the site. Pedestrian access is
        proposed to be provided along those routes and also by a staircase and handicapped accessible
                                      rd
        ramp to Gaffey Street at 33 Street. A stairway was located there when the pool was formerly in
                                                                             rd
        public use and a crosswalk on Gaffey Street was present at 33 Street to facilitate pedestrian
        crossings.

    ·   The project is estimated to generate a total of approximately 364 daily vehicle trips, including
        approximately 70 trips in the PM peak hour.

    ·   Detailed intersection capacity and operation analyses were conducted at two intersections in the
        vicinity of the project site for the weekday afternoon peak hour (between 3:00 to 6:00 PM). Both
        intersections are operating at good levels of service (LOS A and B). Potential traffic impacts were
        assessed against Existing conditions and against Cumulative (2016) conditions and it was
        determined that the project would result in less than significant impacts, based on the City's
        significant impact criteria. Impacts to CMP roadway and transit facilities were also found to be less
        than significant.
