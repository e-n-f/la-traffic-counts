Introduction

This study identifies the potential traffic impacts associated with the proposed Valley Region Elementary
School #13 (hereafter refer to as "Project"). The proposed school site is located at northeast corner of
Lanark Street and Cedros Avenue in the community of Panorama City within the City of Los Angeles.
Figure 1 shows the location of the proposed Project site.

The proposed 950-seat elementary school would relieve student overcrowding in other schools in the
vicinity which includes Burton, Chase, Noble, Panorama City, Ranchito, Valerio Elementary Schools and
Valerio Primary Center. The Project includes the construction of a school building, play areas, on-site
service loading areas, and parking lot. Construction is anticipated to be completed by 2012. The
proposed Project would replace the nine existing single family residential units and 89,620 square feet of
manufacturing use which currently occupies four parcels.

The Project study area, as defined through consultation with the Los Angeles Department of
Transportation (LADOT) includes six key study intersections. Traffic impacts were analyzed during
weekday AM peak hour at the six study intersections. Per LADOT guidelines, the traffic analysis includes
the following traffic scenarios:

     ·     Existing 2008 Conditions
     ·     Future 2012 Without Project Conditions
     ·     Future 2012 With Project Conditions

Prior to the start of the study, KOA coordinated with staff from the LADOT to obtain consensus on
the traffic scope, methodology and assumptions. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was
prepared and submitted to LADOT for review and approval. A copy of the MOU is provided in
Appendix A.

Project Study Area

The Project study area is defined by the following six key study intersections:

     1.    Willis Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard (Signalized)
     2.    Van Nuys Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard (Signalized)
     3.    Willis Avenue and Titus Street (Stop Controlled)
     4.    Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street (Signalized)
     5.    Willis Avenue and Lanark Street (Stop Controlled)
     6.    Van Nuys Boulevard and Lanark Street (Signalized)

Figure 1 also shows the location of the six study intersections.

Project Access

Access to the elementary school parking lot will be provided on Titus Street. The student drop-off
location is located on the east side of Cedros Avenue fronting the Project site. Figure 2 shows the
Project site plan.

Analysis Methodology

The proposed Project site is located within the City of Los Angeles. KOA coordinated with LADOT at
the start of this study to achieve consensus on assumptions such as study intersections, ambient growth
and related projects, and trip reduction credits.

Guidelines defined by LADOT's "Guidelines for Traffic Impact Analysis Reports" were utilized to
develop this traffic study. The general methodology and assumptions contained in this report are based
on the Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between LAUSD and LADOT. After follow-up
correspondence and additional research, a subsequent MOU, including all other major traffic study
assumptions, was submitted to LADOT. An approved MOU was received from LADOT on April 14,
2008.

The list of study intersections is finalized through this process, as is the trip generation assumptions and
information on related area projects. The following text describes the methodology for this report as
defined in the MOU.

Existing 2008 Conditions

Fieldwork within the Project study area was undertaken to identify the condition of major roadways, to
identify traffic control and approach lane configuration at each study intersection, and to identify the
locations of on-street parking and transit stops.

KOA compiled new manual intersection turn movement counts at four of the six study intersections on
May 15th (Thursday) of 2008. Peak period turning movement counts were collected at the study
intersections between the hours of 6:30 AM and 8:30 AM. Due to the current construction activity
along Roscoe Boulevard, KOA did not collect new counts at the intersections of Willis Avenue/Roscoe
Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard/Roscoe Boulevard. Historical count data at the two intersections
were provided from LADOT and were adjusted to reflect current conditions. Traffic count summaries
are provided in Appendix B of this report.

Existing level of service at each of the six study intersections is discussed in the subsequent "Existing
Conditions" section of this report.

Future 2012 Without Project Conditions

In order to acknowledge regional traffic growth that would affect operations at the study intersections
during the Project opening year of 2012, an ambient/background traffic growth rate was applied. Per
LADOT guidance, an annual rate of 2% was utilized. A growth factor of 1.08 was used to estimate 2012
traffic conditions.

In addition to future ambient growth, traffic from area-related projects (approved and pending
developments) was also included as part of the 2012 analysis. LADOT provided a list of area projects
that would add measurable volumes to the study area intersections.

Project Trip Generation and Distribution

Forecast Project trip generation was based on the Valley Region trip generation rates defined in Table 1
of the June 24, 2005 MOC between LADOT and LAUSD. The methodology utilized for Project trip
distribution calculations is discussed further in the "Future With Project" section of this report.

Level of Service Methodology

For analysis of Level of Service (LOS) at signalized intersections, LADOT has designated the Circular
212 Planning methodology as the desired tool. The concept of roadway level of service under the
Circular 212 method is calculated as the volume of vehicles that pass through the facility divided by the
capacity of that facility. A facility is "at capacity" (V/C of 1.00 or greater) whereby extreme congestion
occurs. This volume/capacity ratio value is a function of hourly volumes signal phasing, and approach
lane configuration on each leg of the intersection.

For the stop-controlled intersections of Willis Avenue/Titus Street and Willis Avenue/Lanark Street,
LOS were evaluated by treating the intersection as two-phase signalized intersection and reducing the
capacity to 1,200 vehicles-per-hour-per-lane to reflect lower stop-controlled intersection's capacity per
LADOT.

LOS values range from LOS A to LOS F. LOS A indicates excellent operating conditions with little delay
to motorists, whereas LOS F represents congested conditions with excessive vehicle delay. LOS E is
typically defined as the operating "capacity" of a roadway.

Table 1 defines the level of service criteria.

                               Very good operation. Many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                               restricted within platoons of vehicles. This represents stable

                               flow. An approach to an intersection may occasionally be fully

Automated Traffic Surveillance And Control (ATSAC) Project and Adaptive Traffic Control
System (ATCS)

Based on information obtained from LADOT, all the four signalized study intersections are currently
equipped with Automated Traffic Surveillance And Control (ATSAC) or Adaptive Traffic Control
System (ATCS).

ATSAC is a computer-based traffic signal control system whereby engineers monitor traffic conditions
and system performance, selects appropriate signal timing (control) strategies, and performs equipment
diagnostics and alert functions. Sensors in the street detect the passage of vehicles, vehicle speed, and
the level of congestion. This information is received on a second-by-second (real-time) basis and is
analyzed on a minute-by-minute basis at the ATSAC Operations Center to determine if better traffic
flow can be achieved by changing the signal timing. If required, the signal timing is either automatically
changed by the ATSAC computers or manually changed by the operator using communication lines that
connect the ATSAC Center with each traffic signal. To supplement the information from electronic
detectors, closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance equipment has been and continues to be
installed at critical locations throughout the City.

ATCS is the latest enhancement to ATSAC and uses a personal computer-based traffic signal control
software program which provides fully traffic adaptive signal control based on real-time traffic
conditions. The ATCS will automatically adjust traffic signal timing in response to current traffic
demands by allowing ATCS to simultaneously control all three critical components of traffic signal
timing, namely cycle length, phase split and offset.

For capacity analysis, LADOT guidelines suggest a 0.10 reduction in volume-to-capacity ratio with the
implementation of ATSAC/ATCS. This reduction represents field measured benefits in flow and capacity
increase by operation of this program. For the purpose of traffic impact analysis, ATSAC/ATCS credits
are applied to the existing and future conditions four the four signalized intersections.

Significant Traffic Impacts

As defined by LADOT traffic study guidelines, significant impacts of a proposed project at an
intersection must be mitigated to a level of insignificance. In cases where capacity increases are possible,
KOA analyzed mitigation measures that would restore operations commensurate with the future pre-
Project period or better.

Existing 2008 Conditions

This section describes the existing conditions within the study area, in terms of roadway facilities and
operating conditions within the study area.

Existing Roadway System

Fieldwork within the Project study area was undertaken to identify traffic control and approach lane
configuration at each study intersection, and to identify the locations of on-street parking and transit
stops. Key roadways within the study area are described in Table 2. The discussion presented here is
limited to specific roadways that traverse the study intersections and serve the Project site. Figure 3
shows the existing intersection geometry.

Existing Transit Service

Table 3 provides a description of the transit lines that traverse major roadway corridors in the
immediate vicinity of the Project site. The Project would be well-served by multiple transit lines that lie
within walking distance of the Project site.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service

Based on the AM peak period traffic counts at the study area intersections, a volume-to-capacity ratio
and corresponding level of service were determined for all of the study area intersections. Table 4
provides the level of service results at each study intersection under existing 2008 conditions.

Existing Traffic Volumes

KOA compiled new manual intersection turn movement counts that were conducted at the four of the
six study intersections on May 15th (Thursday) of 2008. Peak period turning movement counts were
collected between the hours of 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM. The results of counts were utilized to determine
existing weekday AM peak-hour conditions. Due to the construction activity along Roscoe Boulevard,
KOA did not collect new counts at the intersections of Willis Avenue/Roscoe Boulevard and Van Nuys
Boulevard/Roscoe Boulevard. Historical counts at the two intersections were provided by LADOT.
The count data were adjusted to reflect current conditions.

Traffic counts at the intersection of Willis Avenue/Roscoe Boulevard were conducted in the year 2002
and traffic counts at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard/Roscoe Boulevard were conducted in the
year 2007. In order to reflect the 2008 existing conditions, an overall growth factor of 1.12 and 1.02 was
applied to these intersections, respectively. The growth factors are based on an annual average growth
rate of 2-percent per year. Traffic count summaries are provided in Appendix B of this report. Figure 4
shows the existing AM peak-hour intersection volumes.

Future 2012 Without Project Conditions

This section provides an analysis of future traffic conditions in the study area with ambient growth and
related projects but without traffic from the proposed Project. The year 2012 was selected for analysis
based on the anticipated completion/occupancy date of the Project.

Ambient Growth
The travel forecast includes an ambient growth increase to account for both regional population and
employment growth outside of the study area. Per LADOT, an annual growth rate of 2% was utilized
specifically for this study. The growth rate translates to a growth factor of 1.08 which was applied to
existing traffic counts to reflect 2012 base conditions. This annual rate was included in the April 14,
2008 LADOT MOU.

Related Projects
Other approved and pending projects in the vicinity of the proposed Project site were provided by
LADOT. A list of 12 area projects was included in the traffic analysis. Table 5 summarizes the trip
generation of related projects. This traffic was added to the surrounding street system.

Figure 5 shows the locations of the related projects. Figure 6 shows the 2012 future without project AM
peak hour intersection traffic volumes.

As shown in Table 6, operations at all the six study intersections are expected to worsen due to added
traffic from regional traffic growth as well as traffic from other development projects near/within the
study area. With the added background traffic growth that is expected, all six intersections are
expected to continue to operate at LOS D or better during the AM peak hour.

Future 2012 without-Project level of service worksheets are provided in Appendix D.

Future 2012 With Project Conditions

This section describes the future 2012 with proposed Project traffic conditions within the study area.

Project Trip Generation

Table 7 summarizes the project's trip generation rates as contained in the June 24, 2005 Memorandum
of Cooperation between LAUSD and LADOT. The trip generation estimates for this project are
calculated from these rates. Single Family and Manufacturing trip rates are based on Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation 7th Edition.

Based on the trip rates shown, the Project would generate 561 trips during the AM peak hour, with 295
trips entering the site and 266 exiting the site during the peak hour. With the existing trip credit of 73
trips during the AM peak hour due to the removal of nine single family homes and 89,620 square feet of
manufacturing uses, the Project would generate 488 net trips during the AM peak hour, with 243 trips
entering the site and 245 trips exiting the site during the peak hour.

Project Trip Distribution

Trip distribution is the process of assigning the directions from which traffic will access a project site.
Trip distribution is dependent upon the land use characteristics of the Project and the general locations
of other land uses to which project trips would originate or terminate. Based on consultation with
LADOT staff, a trip distribution pattern was developed specifically for this Project. Figure 7 illustrates
the intersection trip distribution percentages that were utilized for Project traffic.

Project Trip Assignment

Based on the trip generation and distribution assumptions described above, Project traffic was assigned
onto the roadway system based on driveway locations and the availability of local roadways to access
the regional highway system. The Project-only AM peak hour trip assignment is illustrated in Figure 8.

The Project generated trips were superimposed onto the "Future Without-Project" forecasts to
estimate future With-Project traffic conditions. Figure 9 illustrates the resultant traffic forecasts for the
AM peak hour.

Traffic impacts are identified if the proposed development will result in a significant change in traffic
conditions at a study intersection. A significant impact is typically identified if project-related traffic will
cause service levels to deteriorate beyond a threshold limit specified by the overseeing agency. Impacts
can also be significant if an intersection is already operating below the poorest acceptable level and
project traffic will cause a further decline below a certain threshold.

The City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation has established specific thresholds for project
related increases in the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) of signalized study intersections. The following
increases in peak-hour V/C ratios are considered "significant" impacts:

        Level of Service                       Final V/C*                             Project Related v/c increase
        C                                      < 0.70 ­ 0.80                          Equal to or greater than 0.040
        D                                      < 0.80 ­ 0.90                          Equal to or greater than 0.020
        E and F                                0.90 or more                           Equal to or greater than 0.010
       Note: Final V/C is the V/C ratio at an intersection, considering impacts from the project, ambient and related project growth,
       and without proposed traffic impact mitigations.

Table 8 displays a comparison of all study scenarios. Traffic impacts created by the Project were
calculated by subtracting the V/C values in the "Future With-Project" column from the value in the
"Future Without-Project" column.

The future 2012 With-Project level of service worksheets for this scenario are included in Appendix E
of this report.

Based on LADOT's criteria for identification of significant impacts, the proposed Project is expected to
create significant traffic impacts at the following three study intersections:

     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard
     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street
     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Lanark Street

Proposed Mitigation Measures

Based on the Project impacts identified previously, below is the summary of the proposed mitigation
measures:

     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street: The recommended mitigation measure is to provide the
           eastbound and westbound approaches with a left turn lane and a shared through-right turn lane.
           On the west-leg of Titus Street, the current curb width is 36 feet. In order to provide a
           separate left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane in the eastbound approach, the
           roadway will require restriping. No roadway widening nor on-street parking removal are
           anticipated. On the east-leg of Titus Street, the current curb width is 36 feet. In order to
           provide a separate left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane in the westbound
           approach, the roadway will require restriping and removal/restriction of on-street parking. No
           roadway widening is anticipated. With the proposed mitigation measure, the intersection would
           operate at LOS B (V/C = 0.681) during AM peak hour. The proposed mitigation measure would
           fully mitigate Project related traffic impacts at the study intersection.

     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Lanark Street: The recommended mitigation is to provide the
           eastbound and westbound approaches with a left turn lane and a shared through-right turn lane.
           On the west-leg of Lanark Street, the current curb width is 40 feet. In order to provide a
           separate left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane in the eastbound approach, the
           roadway will require restriping and removal/restriction of on-street parking. No roadway
           widening is anticipated. On the east-leg of Lanark Street, the current curb width is 36 feet. In
           order to provide a separate left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane in the westbound
           approach, the roadway will require restriping and removal/restriction of on-street parking. No
           roadway widening is anticipated. With the proposed mitigation measure, the intersection would
           operate at LOS C (V/C = 0.761) during AM peak hour. The proposed mitigation measure would
           fully mitigate Project related traffic impacts at the study intersection.

Unavoidable Significant Traffic Impacts

     ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard: No feasible mitigation measures are available at
           this location. The intersection is buildout and physical improvements such as roadway widening
           and restriping are not available. The Project is expected to create significant and unavoidable
           traffic impacts at this intersection.

Reduced Project Alternative

This section provides a summary of potential traffic impacts associated with the reduced Project
alternative. The reduced alternative includes up to 650 seats, a 300-seat decrease from the preferred
950-seat.

Project Trip Generation

Based on trip rates contained in the June 24, 2005 Memorandum of Cooperation between LAUSD and
LADOT, Table 9 summarizes the reduced project's trip generation estimates. Based on the trip rates
shown, the reduced Project of 650 seats would generate 311 net trips during the AM peak period, with
150 trips entering the site and 161 exiting the site during the peak hour.

The reduced trip generation estimates are lower than the preferred Project alternative. The reduction
of 300 seats would yield approximately 177 less trips during the AM peak hour (from 488 trips to 311
trips).

Based on the trip distribution and assignment methodologies that were utilized for the proposed full
Project, the reduced-alternative Project trips were forecasted at the six study intersections. The
forecasted intersection volumes were superimposed onto future no-project conditions to estimate the
potential increase in traffic impacts due to the vehicular trips generated by the 650 seats.

Note:
[a] Stop-controlled intersection. LOS was calculated based on the 1,200 capacity utilizing the Circular 212 methodology.
[b] Per LADOT, signalized intersections are equipped with ATSAC and ATCS.


Based on LADOT's criteria for significant impacts, the reduced Project alternative is expected to create
significant traffic impacts at the following study intersections:

       ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street
       ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Lanark Street

The reduced Project alternative would require traffic mitigation measures to alleviate significant impacts
identified. The proposed mitigation measures that identified for the preferred 950-seat scenario would
also be required in the reduced 650-seat alterative. With the proposed mitigation measures, Project
related traffic impacts at the intersections of Van Nuys Boulevard/Titus Street and Van Nuys
Boulevard/Lanark Street would be fully mitigated. With the proposed mitigation measures, the
intersections would operate at:

       ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Titus Street ­ V/C=0.660 (LOS B)
       ·     Van Nuys Boulevard and Lanark Street ­ V/C=0.734 (LOS C)

Pedestrian Analysis
This report section summarizes the pedestrian analysis conducted for the proposed project. KOA
surveyed various possible pedestrian routes within the Project study area. The following provides an
overview of pedestrian-related traffic control in the vicinity of the Project site and pedestrian routes.
Figure 10 shows the selected pedestrian routes. Generally, the study area is buildout and offers
adequate pedestrian serving amenities such as:

     ·     Pedestrian signals at signalized intersections (push buttons)
     ·     Sidewalks
     ·     Crosswalks

Existing Pedestrian-Oriented Traffic Controls

The Project study area was surveyed to determine the location of existing traffic controls in the area
that could be utilized by students to access the proposed school site from adjacent neighborhoods.
Traffic control device locations that were documented included traffic signals, signed and striped
crosswalks, and all-way stop-controlled intersections. Figure 10 also illustrates the inventory of current
pedestrian facilities within the study area.

Pedestrian Volume Calculations

Utilizing mode split characteristics of LAUSD schools, established by surveys conducted for the LAUSD
Program EIR (Meyer, Mohaddes Associates, Inc. ­ November, 2003), the number of anticipated students
who would walk to and from the school site was calculated. The Program EIR defines the following
percentage breakdowns an elementary school project mode splits:

Elementary School
     ·     Trips by car total 55.19% of all trips
     ·     Trips by walking/biking total 42.33% of all trips
     ·     Trips via school bus and public transit total 2.48% of all trips

For the Project traffic study, outbound AM peak vehicle volumes are examined, representing returning
drop-off trips, departing delivery trips, etc. For the pedestrian analysis, it was assumed that no
measurable outbound pedestrian volumes would be present in the AM peak hour. Therefore, only
inbound pedestrian volumes were examined in this analysis.

Based on the mode split for the elementary school type listed above and factoring 1.5 to account for
parents, the estimated additional number of school related pedestrians is 296 during the AM peak hour.
Figure 11 illustrates the estimated volume and distribution of pedestrians along the study routes.

Current Deficiencies

Based on field observation/inventory, the following pedestrian-related facilities have been identified as
deficient and requires repair:

     ·     Willis Avenue - North of Titus Street on the east side of the street ­ existing sidewalks need
           repair
     ·     Willis Avenue - North of Lanark Street on the east side of the street ­ existing sidewalks need
           repair

Recommended Pedestrian Related Improvements

As part of the pedestrian related improvements, it is also recommended that the crosswalks should be
installed at the following locations:

           Cedros Avenue and Titus Street.
           Natick Avenue and Titus Street.
           Willis Avenue and Titus Street.
           Willis Avenue and Cantara Street.
           Willis Avenue and Lanark Street.
           Natick Avenue and Lanark Street.

           Willis Avenue and Lorne Street.
           Willis Avenue and Strathern Street.
           Willis Avenue and Blythe Street.
Figure 12 shows the locations where the crosswalks are recommended.
In addition to the sidewalk improvement and crosswalk installation, stop signs should be installed at the
following locations:
           Cedros Avenue and Titus Street - All way stop sign.
           Natick Avenue and Titus Street - All way stop sign
           Natick Avenue and Strathern Street - One way stop sign (Southbound)

The preliminary recommended improvements provided shall be considered as part of the environmental
review process only. It should be noted that the recommended improvements such as loading zones,
pedestrian routes and crossings would need to be refined and revised as needed to ensure that those
improvements are based on a more specific source rather than lengthy future projections. Thus, the
mitigation measures proposed in the MOC document shall be considered as follows:

LAUSD's OEHS will incorporate the following mitigation measures, where necessary, into the traffic
analysis for new school projects.

           1)      Six months prior to opening of the school, LAUSD's OEHS shall contact LADOT's
                   Citywide Traffic Control Programs Section for preparation of a "Pedestrian Routes to
                   School" map. As part of the "Pedestrian Routes to School", parents and students shall be
                   notified to use the existing traffic safeguards.

           2)      Four months prior to opening of the school, LAUSD's OEHS shall contact LADOT to
                   coordinate the installation of appropriate traffic controls, school warning and speed limit
                   signs, school crosswalks, and pavement markings.

           3)      Four months prior to opening of the school, LAUSD's OEHS shall contact LADOT to
                   coordinate the installation of signs to create passenger loading zones. The signs for the
                   passenger loading zones would state, "Passenger Loading Only 6:30 - 9:00 AM and 1:30 -
                   4:00 p.m., and 2-Hour Parking 9:00 AM to 1:30 p.m.", or "15-Minute Parking 7:00 AM to
                   5:00 p.m. School Days", or provide other notice as deemed appropriate by LAUSD. A
                   sign noting "School Bus Loading Only" shall be placed in the school bus loading area. The
                   precise locations and lengths of the restricted on-street parking zones would be
                   determined jointly by LAUSD and LADOT.

           4)      After occupancy of the school, the LAUSD shall request LADOT's Crossing Guard
                   Operations Section to conduct a study for the assignment of crossing guards at designated
                   intersections, as needed, to enhance pedestrian safety. If a crossing guard is warranted,
                   LAUSD shall coordinate with LADOT to provide crossing guards where necessary.

Congestion Management Plan Conformance
This section demonstrates the ways in which this traffic study was prepared to be in conformance with
the procedures mandated by the County of Los Angeles Congestion Management Program.

The Congestion Management Program (CMP) was created statewide because of Proposition 111 and
was implemented locally by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA).
The CMP for Los Angeles County requires that the traffic impact of individual development projects of
potentially regional significance be analyzed. A specific system of arterial roadways plus all freeways
comprises the CMP system. Per CMP Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines, a traffic impact
analysis is conducted where:

     ·     At CMP arterial monitoring intersections, including freeway on-ramps or off-ramps, where the
           proposed project will add 50 or more vehicle trips during either AM or PM weekday peak
           hours.

     ·     At CMP mainline freeway-monitoring locations, where the project will add 150 or more trips, in
           either direction, during the either the AM or PM weekday peak hours.

The nearest CMP arterial monitoring intersection to the project site is Sepulveda Boulevard and Victory
Boulevard. Based on the Project trip generation and the distance of these CMP routes from the study
intersections, it is not expected that 50 or more new trips per hour would be added to these locations.
Therefore, no further analysis of potential CMP impacts is required.

The nearest CMP mainline freeway-monitoring location to the project site is on I-405 north off Roscoe
Boulevard. Based on the trip distribution and traffic assignment presented, the proposed Project is
primarily local traffic rather than regional traffic. The proposed Project is expected to add less than 150
new trips per hour to any freeway segments near the Project site since the project generates
local/neighborhood trips than regional trips. Therefore, no further analysis of CMP freeway monitoring
stations is required.

Summary and Project Recommendations
Analysis Conclusions

The following summarizes the traffic study results, findings and conclusions:

     ·     Under existing 2008 conditions, all the six study intersections are operating at LOS B or better
           during AM peak hour.

     ·     Under future 2012 without Project conditions, 12 related projects were included along with an
           annual average growth rate of 2%.

     ·     Under future 2012 without Project conditions, all the six study intersections are expected to
           operate at LOS D or better during the AM peak hour.

     ·     The proposed Project with 950 seats would add a net 488 AM peak hour trips to the local
           roadway system.

     ·     Based on the City of Los Angeles significant impact criteria, the proposed 950-seat school would
           create significant impacts at three locations including the intersections of Van Nuys
           Boulevard/Roscoe Boulevard, Van Nuys Boulevard/Titus Street and Van Nuys Boulevard/Lanark
           Street.

     ·     Implementation of proposed intersection improvements would mitigate the project impacts to a
           level of insignificance at the intersections of Van Nuys Boulevard/Titus Street and Van Nuys
           Boulevard/Lanark Street.

     ·     The intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard is buildout. There are no
           feasible improvements available at this location. Project traffic impacts would remain significant
           and unavoidable at this location.

     ·     The reduced Project alternative with 650 seats would add a net 311 AM peak hour trips to the
           local roadway system.

     ·     Based on the City of Los Angeles significant impact criteria, the reduced Project alternative with
           650-seat school would create significant impacts at the intersections of Van Nuys
           Boulevard/Titus Street and Van Nuys Boulevard/Lanark Street.                 Proposed roadway
           improvements would fully mitigate Project impacts.

     ·     As part of pedestrian related improvements, crosswalks are recommended at several locations,
           sidewalk improvements are recommended along Willis Avenue north off Titus Street and
           Lanark Street on the east side. In addition, installation of stop signs are recommended at three
           locations within the study area.
