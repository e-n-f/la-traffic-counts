This report documents the results of a study conducted by Kaku Associates, Inc. to evaluate the
potential traffic impacts and pedestrian circulation needs of the proposed Valley Region
Elementary School Number 10 Project (project) in the Canoga Park area of the San Fernando
Valley in Los Angeles County. The project site is located at 7330 Winnetka Avenue at the
southwest corner of Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street. This study is designed to become an
integral element of an environmental document being prepared to evaluate the overall impacts of
this project. It includes a description of the assumptions and methods used to conduct the study
as well as a discussion of the results.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The new 650-seat two-semester elementary school (grades K through 5), with approximately
50,000 square feet of development including 26 classrooms, is intended to relieve overcrowding
at the existing Winnetka Avenue, Melvin Avenue, Hart Street, and Fullbright Elementary Schools.
The project is proposed to utilize the northeast corner of the existing Sutter Middle School site
bounded by Valerio Street to the north and Lubao Avenue to the east. The existing Sutter Middle
School site is generally bounded by Valerio Street to the north, Winnetka Avenue to the west,
Sherman Way to the south, and Lubao Avenue to the east. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the
project in relation to the surrounding street system. Figure 2 illustrates the general site layout and
driveway locations.


Based on a cursory review of the proposed site plan from the Los Angeles Unified School District
(LAUSD), as shown in Figure 2, pick-up and drop-off access would be provided along the west
side of Lubao Avenue and parking lot access would be provided from Valerio Street.               The
proposed project would provide 63 surface parking spaces.




                                                  1
STUDY SCOPE


The scope of analysis for this study was developed in consultation with staff of both the Los
Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) and LAUSD. The base assumptions, technical
methodologies, and study area were identified as part of the study approach.


The traffic impact study to evaluate the potential for impacts caused by the project includes an
analysis of the following traffic scenarios:


    ·   Existing (2006) Conditions - The analysis of existing traffic conditions is intended to
        provide a basis for the remainder of the study. The existing conditions analysis includes
        an assessment of streets, traffic volumes and operating conditions.

    ·   Cumulative Base (2010) Conditions - Future traffic conditions are projected for the year
        2010 without the proposed project. The objective of this analysis is to forecast the future
        traffic growth and intersection operating conditions expected to result from general
        regional growth and specific related projects developed in the vicinity of the project site by
        the year 2010. This scenario is used as the baseline against which potential project traffic
        impacts are evaluated.

    ·   Cumulative (2010) plus Project - This is an analysis of future traffic conditions with traffic
        expected to be generated by the proposed project added to the year 2010 cumulative
        base traffic forecasts. The incremental impacts of the proposed project on future traffic
        operating conditions can then be identified.


The study area for this analysis includes the following intersections:


        1. Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way (signalized)
        2. Winnetka Avenue and Valerio Street (signalized)
        3. Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street (stop-controlled)
        4. Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way (stop-controlled)


The intersections to be analyzed, illustrated in Figure 1, were determined by LADOT staff as part
of the development of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the project. The MOU is
attached in Appendix A of this report. This report follows guidelines agreed on in the MOU and is
in accordance with the June 24, 2005 Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between LADOT and
LAUSD. Use of trip generation rates, methodologies, and other standards in the MOC document
provides for consistency of traffic studies for LAUSD new school projects within various
jurisdictions. The MOC also specifies that potential project-related impacts need to be assessed


                                                  4
only during the a.m. peak period (not during the p.m. peak period), and that neighborhood traffic
impacts are to be assessed qualitatively.


This study also examines the ability of the proposed future on-site parking supply to
accommodate projected parking requirements associated with the project. The site access and
internal circulation plan proposed as part of the project were also evaluated to ensure they are
adequate to accommodate anticipated flows. As a matter of practice, LAUSD requires that traffic
studies for all school projects include a pedestrian analysis. In order to provide consistency with
all new school traffic studies, a pedestrian analysis was conducted for the project.




ORGANIZATION OF REPORT


This report is divided into nine chapters, including this introduction. Chapter II presents an
analysis of the existing street system and traffic conditions for each of the intersections in the
study area. Forecasts of future traffic including project-generated and cumulative traffic are
presented in Chapter III.    Potential impacts of the project on the study intersections are
discussed in Chapter IV. The identification of measures required to mitigate project impacts are
discussed in Chapter V. Parking and vehicular access are discussed in Chapter VI. Chapter
VII provides a pedestrian analysis. Chapter VIII includes a Congestion Management Program
analysis.   Finally, a summary of the analyses and study conclusions makes up Chapter IX.
Appendices to this report include details of the technical analysis and supporting calculation
worksheets.

                                    II. EXISTING CONDITIONS




A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of
existing conditions in the study area. The assessment of conditions relevant to this study includes
land use, an inventory of the local street system, traffic volumes on these facilities, and operating
conditions at key intersections.




STREETS AND HIGHWAYS


The study area for this analysis is bounded by Oso Avenue to the west, Sherman Way to the
south, Corbin Avenue to the east, and Saticoy Street to the north. Primary regional access to
the area is provided by the Ventura Freeway (US-101), which runs in an east-west direction
approximately one and a half miles south of the project site. Primary local access is provided by
Winnetka Avenue, Sherman Way, Lubao Avenue, and Valerio Street. The following describes
the key streets serving the project site:


   ·   Winnetka Avenue ­ Winnetka Avenue is classified as a major highway north of Ventura
       Boulevard. Four through lanes and a two-way continuous left-turn lane are provided north
       of Ventura Boulevard. On-street parking is available throughout the study area with
       curbside parking prohibited during school hours on the east side of the street from
       Leadwell Avenue to Valerio Street. Recommendations contained in Transportation
       Element of the General Plan (Bicycle Plan, Citywide Bikeways System - Valley
       Geographical Area) (City of Los Angeles Planning Department, December 2001)
       propose Class II bike lanes along Winnetka Avenue north of Ventura Boulevard.

   ·   Sherman Way ­ Sherman Way is an east-west major highway south of the project site.
       It is classified as a divided major highway with six through lanes and a raised median
       island. On-street parking is available in the study area.

   ·   Lubao Avenue ­ Lubao Avenue is a north-south local roadway east of the project site.
       On-street parking is available throughout the study area. All of the proposed project traffic
       would access the school site from Lubao Avenue, with pick-up and drop-off access
       provided along the west side of the street.




                                                 6
    ·   Valerio Street ­ Valerio Street is an east-west local roadway north of the project site. On-
        street parking is available at any time on both the north and south curbsides between
        Corbin Avenue and Quakertown Avenue. Curbside parking is prohibited between
        Winnetka Avenue and Quakertown during school hours.

Table 1 summarizes the physical characteristics of the key streets in the study area. Diagrams
of the existing lane configurations at the analyzed intersections are shown in Appendix B.




EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE


The following sections present the existing peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, a
description of the methodology used to analyze the intersection traffic conditions, and the resulting
level of service at each of the study intersections under existing conditions.




Existing Traffic Volumes


Weekday morning peak hour traffic counts (6:30 to 8:30 a.m.) were conducted at the study
intersections on Wednesday, November 30, 2005 as part of this study. This traffic volume data
was adjusted by an ambient growth rate of 1% to represent existing 2006 traffic conditions. Traffic
count data sheets are contained in Appendix C and the existing peak hour traffic volumes are
illustrated in Figure 3.




Level of Service Methodology


Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow,
ranging from excellent conditions at LOS A to overloaded conditions at LOS F. LOS D is
typically considered to be the minimum acceptable LOS in urban areas. The intersections of
Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way and Winnetka Avenue and Valerio Street are controlled by
signals, while the intersections of Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street and Lubao Avenue and
Sherman Way are stop-controlled. Tables 2 and 3 provide LOS definitions for signalized and
stop-controlled intersections, respectively.

    A             < 0.600         EXCELLENT. No vehicle waits longer than one red
                                     light, and no approach phase is fully used.

                                    VERY GOOD. An occasional approach phase is
    B         > 0.600 < 0.700      fully utilized; many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                                            restricted within groups of vehicles.

                                     GOOD. Occasionally drivers may have to wait
    C         > 0.700 < 0.800        through more than one red light; backups may
                                            develop behind turning vehicles.


                                   FAIR. Delays may be substantial during portions
    D         > 0.800 < 0.900     of the rush hours, but enough lower volume periods
                                       occur to permit clearing of developing lines,
                                             preventing excessive backups.


                                   POOR. Represents the most vehicles intersection
    E         > 0.900 < 1.000      approaches can accommodate; may be long lines
                                    of waiting vehicles through several signal cycles.


                                    FAILURE. Backups from nearby locations or on
                                   cross streets may restrict or prevent movement of
    F             > 1.000             vehicles out of the intersection approaches.
                                    Tremendous delays with continuously increasing
                                                     queue lengths.

LADOT requires that the Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) method (Transportation Research
Board, 1980) of intersection capacity analysis be used to determine the intersection volume-to-
capacity (V/C) ratio and corresponding LOS for the given turning movements and intersection
characteristics at signalized intersections. The intersection of Winnetka Avenue and Sherman
Way is controlled by the City of Los Angeles' Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control
(ATSAC) system. Per LADOT procedures, a capacity increase of 7% (0.07 V/C adjustment)
was applied to reflect the benefits of ATSAC control at this intersection.


The Four-Way Stop-Controlled methodology and the Two-Way Stop-Controlled methodology from
2000 Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2000) were used to determine
the average vehicle delay (in seconds) and the corresponding LOS for the stop-controlled
intersections of Lubao Avenue/Valerio Street and Lubao Avenue/Sherman Way.




Existing Peak Hour Levels of Service


The existing weekday morning peak hour turning movements presented in Figure 3 were used in
conjunction with the LOS methodologies described above to determine existing operating
conditions at each study intersection. LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix D.
Table 4 summarizes the a.m. peak hour V/C ratios and corresponding LOS at each study
intersection. The results of this analysis indicate that three of the study intersections are currently
operating at acceptable LOS (i.e., LOS D or better) during the morning peak hour. The exception
is the stop-controlled intersection of Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way. The most constrained
stop-controlled approach to this intersection (the southbound approach) currently operates at
LOS F during the morning peak hour. Drivers on Lubao Avenue at the stop sign experience an
average vehicle delay of over 180 seconds per vehicle before they find a safe gap to merge with
through traffic on Sherman Way, while the main stream of the traffic flow on Sherman Way
(eastbound and westbound approach) is unimpeded.

The Metro Orange Line, which opened to traffic in fall 2005, travels on Victory Boulevard
approximately one-half mile south of the project site and has a station at the intersection of
Winnetka Avenue and Victory Boulevard (Pierce College Station). The Metro Orange Line is a
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system between the North Hollywood Metro Red Line station and the
Warner Center Transit Hub along the former Southern Pacific Burbank-Chandler branch right-
of-way and Victory Boulevard. The Orange Line provides an average headway of five minutes
during the peak hours on weekdays and 10 minutes on weekends.

                             III. FUTURE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS




In order to evaluate properly the potential impact of the project on the local street system, it was
necessary to develop estimates of future traffic conditions in the area both with and without the
project. Future traffic volumes were first estimated for the study area without the project. These
future forecasts reflect traffic increases due to general regional growth and traffic expected to be
generated by other future developments in the vicinity of the project and represent cumulative
base conditions. Project traffic was added to the cumulative base to represent cumulative plus
project conditions.




CUMULATIVE BASE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The cumulative base traffic projections reflect anticipated future traffic increases that can be
expected from two sources. The first is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects general
increases in traffic due to regional growth and development.         The second source is traffic
generated by specific future projects located within, or in the vicinity of, the study area. The
methods and assumptions used to develop the cumulative base traffic projections are described
below.




Areawide Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase between the year 2006 and the year 2010 as a result of
general areawide and regional growth and development. LADOT has determined that an ambient
growth factor of 2% per year will be used to adjust the existing year 2006 traffic volumes to reflect
the effects of regional growth and development in the project vicinity by the year 2010.




                                                 15
Related Projects Trip Generation and Assignment

The second factor used in the development of the cumulative base traffic forecasts is the effect of
specific known projects in the vicinity of the project. Listings of proposed or recently approved but
uncompleted developments within a two-mile radius of the study intersections were obtained from
LADOT and from the Los Angeles Department of City Planning for this analysis. A review of
these lists indicated that 14 projects have been proposed or approved within the study area.
These projects are described in Table 5 and their locations are illustrated in Figure 4.


Trip Generation. Projected weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour trip generation for most of the
related projects were provided by LADOT. In/out split data from Trip Generation, 7th Edition
(Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2003) was used to split the total peak hour trips obtained
from LADOT for each project into inbound and outbound trips. As indicated in Table 5, the 14
related projects are expected to generate approximately 2,412 trips during the weekday a.m. peak
hour.


Trip Distribution and Assignment. Traffic expected to be generated by the related projects was
assigned to the street network using the trip generation estimates and trip distribution patterns
dependent on the type and density of the proposed land use, the geographic distribution of
population from which the employees and potential patrons of the proposed projects could be
drawn, and the location of the projects in relation to the surrounding street system. These related
project-only traffic volumes were added to the existing traffic volumes, after the adjustment for
areawide growth, to represent cumulative base conditions (i.e., future conditions without the
proposed project). Figure 5 illustrates the cumulative base traffic volumes for 2010.




Baseline Transportation System Improvement


Information regarding committed transportation system improvements programmed for
implementation in the study area was collected.            The Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way
intersection currently provides permissive operation for the left-turn movement at all
approaches; left turns can be made whenever gaps occur in opposing traffic or at the end of the
green phase. Requested by the City's Transportation Committee and Council motion 06-2149
(October 11, 2005) for the Citywide Left-Turn Traffic Signal Program, LADOT has

recommended that a left-turn traffic signal, allowing left turns to be made while opposing
through traffic is stopped, be installed on all approaches of the Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way
intersection by year 2007-2008. This planned change of signal operation is assumed to be in
place at Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way under year 2010 base conditions.




PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Development of future traffic forecasts for the project used a three-step process similar to the
process described for the related projects. The process estimated the project's trip generation,
trip distribution, and traffic assignment.




Project Trip Generation


Traffic generation forecasts for projects such as the proposed project are normally developed by
estimating traffic generation for each land use separately. The project trip generation rates
used for estimating future trips for the project follow the guidelines contained in the June 24,
2005 MOC between LADOT and LAUSD. The rates are based on empirical data of existing
schools in LAUSD's jurisdiction, which has led to the conclusion that the number of trips
generated by school faculty, students, and visitors is based on the number of student seats.
Table 6 presents the trip generation rates and resulting trip generation estimates for the project.
As indicated in the table, the project is expected to generate a net increase of approximately
384 trips (202 inbound, 182 outbound) during the morning peak hour.




Project Trip Distribution


The geographic distribution of traffic generated by the project is dependent on several factors
including the geographic distribution of the population from which the students, employees and
visitors of the proposed developments are drawn, the location of site access points in relation to
the surrounding street system, the level of congestion on local streets, and the physical
characteristics of the street system. The regional trip distribution pattern for the project was




                                                20
developed in consultation with LADOT staff. The resulting inbound and outbound trip distribution
patterns for school traffic are illustrated in Figure 6.




Project Trip Assignment


The project trip generation estimates summarized in Table 6 and the distribution patterns
illustrated in Figure 6 were used to assign the project-generated traffic to the local and regional
street system and through the four study intersections. Figure 7 illustrates the assignment of
the project-generated peak hour traffic volumes at each of the study intersections during a
typical weekday morning peak hour.




CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The project-generated traffic volumes in Figure 7 were then added to the cumulative base traffic
volumes, resulting in the cumulative plus project traffic volumes for the proposed project. Figure 8
illustrates the resulting projected cumulative plus project a.m. peak hour traffic volumes. These
volumes represent projected future weekday peak hour traffic conditions including the
completion of the project.

                                 IV. TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS




This section presents an analysis of the potential impacts of the project on the local street system.
The analysis compares the projected LOS at each study intersection with the project in 2010 to
the cumulative base (no project) scenario to determine potential project impacts, as defined by
significant impact criteria established by the City of Los Angeles.




INTERSECTION SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA


The City of Los Angeles established threshold criteria that determine whether a project has a
significant traffic impact at a specific intersection. Under the city's guidelines, a project impact
would be considered significant if the following conditions are met:


                Intersection Conditions
                     with Project Traffic               Project-related Increase
               LOS             V/C Ratio                      in V/C Ratio
                 C          > 0.700 ­ 0.800           Equal to or greater than 0.040
                 D          > 0.800 ­ 0.900           Equal to or greater than 0.020
               E, F             > 0.900               Equal to or greater than 0.010




CUMULATIVE BASE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS


The results of the analysis of the four study intersections under cumulative base traffic
conditions are summarized in Table 7. Table 7 indicates that two of the four intersections,
Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue/Sherman Way, would operate at LOS F.
Background traffic growth and traffic generated by related projects is expected to cause a
deterioration in operating conditions from the existing conditions for two of the four study
intersections, Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way and Winnetka Avenue/Valerio Street, even
without consideration of potential traffic associated with the project.

 *   Intersection is currently operating under the LADOT ATSAC system. A credit of 0.07 in V/C ratio was included in the above analysis. Installation of left-turn arrow for all approaches assumed complete by year 2007
     - 2008 per LADOT's planned Signal Design Project at Winnetka/Sherman Way intersection.
 [a] Intersection is controlled by stop sign(s). The top rows show analysis using Highway Capacity Manual stop-controlled methodology, for the purpose of evaluating the operating condition of the intersection, average
     vehicular delay in seconds is reported rather than V/C ratio. For the purpose of application of City of Los Angeles significance criteria, the bottom rows show analysis using the CMA methodology and V/C ratio is
     reported.
 [b] Indicates oversaturated conditions for long periods. Delay cannot be calculated.
 [c] Proposed mitigation measures include project's contribution to ATCS uprage at Winnetka Av & Sherman Way and installation of signal at Lubao Av & Sherman Way. LADOT estimates that the ATCS system
     provides an additional capacity increase of about 3% (0.03 V/C adjustment) beyond the 7% increase related to the precursor ATSAC system.
CUMULATIVE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC ANALYSIS


The cumulative plus project peak hour traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 8 were analyzed to
determine the projected year 2010 future operating conditions with the completion of the project.
Application of the significance criteria established by the City of Los Angeles indicates that the
project would create significant traffic impacts at the following two intersections during the morning
peak hour under cumulative plus project conditions:


   ·   Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way
   ·   Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way


Although LADOT has not established guidelines for determining project traffic impacts at a stop-
controlled intersection, the proposed school traffic would result in an adverse impact at the
intersection of Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way given the project-related traffic increase of
0.103 and a final LOS F.       The intersections of Winnetka Avenue/Valerio Street and Lubao
Avenue/Valerio Street, however, would not be significantly impacted.

                                    V. MITIGATION MEASURES




The traffic impact analysis in Chapter IV determined that development of the project is projected
to cause significant impacts at two of the four study intersections. Previously proposed mitigation
measures identified in Revised Draft Traffic Study for the Valley Regional Elementary School #10
(July 2006, Kaku Associates, Inc) include the physical transportation system improvements and
other measures that would mitigate potential impacts for the project. The City's recommended
project requirements are included in Appendix F and will be implemented as conditions of project
approval in order to mitigate the project's traffic impact to less than significant levels.




PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES


Measures to Reduce Travel Demand


The measures discussed in this section were previously proposed as part of the mitigation
program to further reduce travel demand by automobiles during the morning peak hour. LAUSD's
School Traffic and Safety Education Section should coordinate with the City of Los Angeles to
prepare a Pedestrian Routes to School Program. The plan should include all feasible measures
to ensure a high level of pedestrian safety, including but not limited to: school warning and speed
limit signs, school crosswalks, pavement markings, passenger and school bus loading zones and
crossing guard operations. The plan should be finalized before the school opening and include a
map for distribution to all school attendees with clear guidance on safe pedestrian access to
school.     LAUSD should coordinate with the City of Los Angeles in the implementation of
pedestrian safety measures.


Once the project is in place, the following measures may also be considered to reduce travel
demand further:


    ·     Provide a transportation information area, preferential carpool/vanpool parking, access for
          vanpool vehicles in parking areas, a carpool and vanpool loading zone, direct access for
          pedestrians, bicycle parking facilities and direct access to bicycle parking from the street.


                                                   29
    ·   Public transit in the project area is provided by the Metro regional system. LAUSD should
        ensure that transit information is available to students and employees.

It is recommended that LAUSD, in coordination with the City of Los Angeles, implement a TDM
program with emphasis on the faculty and staff of the school utilizing these strategies.
Implementation of such a TDM program would alleviate traffic volumes but it is not expected to
mitigate the significant traffic impacts of the project.




Physical Mitigation Measures


The previously proposed physical mitigation program for the project includes measures to
increase the capacity and/or efficiency of the roadway system at impacted locations.
Opportunities for physical mitigation measures such as restriping of intersection approaches to
add turn lanes and improving traffic control devices were investigated. The emphasis was to
identify physical and/or operational improvements that could be implemented within the existing
roadway right-of-way. The suggested intersection improvement measures for the significantly
impacted intersections are described below and illustrated in Appendix B.


    ·   Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way ­ The intersection of Winnetka Avenue/Sherman
        Way could be mitigated to a less-than-significant level by funding a proportionate share
        of the cost for the design and construction of the Canoga Park Corridor ATSAC/ATCS
        system. LADOT's planned Canoga Park Corridor ATSAC/ATCS Project has proposed
        to upgrade the existing ATSAC controlled intersection of Winnetka Avenue and Sherman
        Way to include Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS) capabilities. LADOT estimates
        that an ATCS upgrade could improve the traffic operations at the intersections while
        providing the additional benefit of V/C reduction by 3% beyond the 7% increase related to
        the precursor ATSAC system.

    ·   Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way ­ Although LADOT has not established guidelines for
        determining project traffic impacts at a stop-controlled intersection, the proposed school
        traffic would results in an adverse impact at this intersection given the project-related
        traffic increase of 0.103 and a final LOS F. The intersection of Lubao Avenue/Sherman
        Way could be mitigated to a less-than-significant level by installing a traffic signal. The
        signal warrant analysis included in Appendix E indicates that, without the presence of
        the proposed school traffic, signal warrants would not be met under either existing
        conditions or future base conditions because the signal warrants require a minimum
        number of vehicles turning from the minor street, Lubao Avenue, to the major street.
        With the presence of the new school traffic (primarily leaving the pick-up and drop-off
        zone) and pedestrian volumes at this location, however, a traffic signal installation at the
        intersection of Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way would be warranted under future plus
        project conditions. With the installation of the traffic signal, the intersection of Lubao


                                                    30
        Avenue/Sherman Way could operate at LOS B and could facilitate the school traffic
        entering and exiting Lubao Avenue more safely.

Although the proposed mitigations appear feasible based on a preliminary field review conducted
at the time of this analysis, their implementation depends on factors outside of the control of
LAUSD. If, during the project development and review process, either mitigation measure were
determined to be infeasible by the responsible agency(ies), the project impacts identified herein
would remain significant and unavoidable.        Projected cumulative plus project intersection
operating conditions with the mitigation strategies are shown in Table 7. As indicated in the table,
the proposed signal system upgrade at Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way and the installation
of a traffic signal at Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way would mitigate the project impacts to a less
than significant level.




CITY-RECOMMENDED CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL


After review of Revised Draft Traffic Study for the Valley Regional Elementary School #10,
LADOT has requested the following improvements be implemented as conditions of project
approval:




Replacement of Previously Proposed Physical Mitigation Measures


    ·   Signal modifications at Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way - The intersection of
        Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level with
        the design and construction of left-turn phasing at this intersection. This measure will
        improve the overall operation of the intersection by reducing left-turn queuing, and
        therefore will serve to mitigate the impacts at this intersection.

    ·   Striping addition at Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue - The intersection of Lubao
        Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level by providing
        striping for one southbound left-turn lane and one southbound right-turn lane.



Other Conditions of Project Approval

    ·   Highway Dedications and Improvement at Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street - Lubao
        Avenue is a designated local street in the Streets and Highways Element of the City's
        General Plan, and consists of a 22-foot half roadway with a soft shoulder and no


                                                31
       sidewalk on a 30-foot half right-of-way. Construction of curb, gutter and sidewalk along
       the adjacent frontage will bring this section of Lubao Avenue up to the standard required
       by the General Plan, with a 18-foot half-roadway on a 30-foot half right-of-way. In
       addition, Valerio Street is a designated collector street in the General Plan, and consists
       of a 20-foot half roadway with existing curb, gutter and sidewalk on a 30-foot half right-
       of-way. A two-foot dedication is required to bring the adjacent frontage of Valerio Street
       up to the standard required by the General Plan, with a 22-foot half roadway on a 32-foot
       half right-of-way.

   ·   Site Access and Internal Circulation - LAUSD has to ensure all loading and unloading of
       students is accomplished on site and shown on the site plan and all driveways are
       designed in accordance with City's standards.


The above transportation improvements are contained in LADOT's traffic assessment letter for
the proposed project, as shown in Appendix F of this report. LAUSD will be responsible for the
implementation cost of the measures discussed above.

                          VI. PARKING ANALYSIS AND VEHICULAR ACCESS




This chapter presents an analysis of the parking supply and access system proposed for the
project.   The parking demand of the project was estimated based on LAUSD's standard
practice. Issues relating to the project's proposed site access scheme are also evaluated.




PARKING ANALYSIS


LAUSD standard practice is to provide 2.25 parking spaces per elementary school classroom to
accommodate faculty, staff and visitor parking needs. Utilizing this practice, the project's 26
classrooms require 59 parking spaces. Since LAUSD proposes to supply 63 off-street parking
spaces, the project would provide a surplus of four on-site parking spaces.




VEHICULAR ACCESS


As shown in Figure 2, three two-way driveways on Valerio Street would provide vehicular
access to the joint-use surface parking area of 219 spaces for both the proposed elementary
school and the existing Sutter Middle School. The easternmost driveway would be dedicated
for the use of the employees and visitors to the project. The two-way driveway on Lubao
Avenue approximately 168 feet south of Valerio Street would provide vehicular access for
service deliveries to the project site. As shown in Figure 2, these driveways vary in width from 25
to 30 feet, allowing sufficient space for two-way operation. Drive aisles directly accessing the four
driveways are also set up for two-way operation. This will simplify on-site circulation and minimize
traffic conflicts within the site.


LAUSD has proposed dedicating a curb-cut along Lubao Avenue as the drop-off/pick-up area for
the elementary school students.      Cars and school buses utilizing this loading zone would
approach the site from the north. The access to the loading zone would be right-in and right-out
only to minimize any U-turns and traffic conflicts between drop-off/pick-up traffic and through



                                                 33
traffic. To minimize pedestrian activity across Lubao Avenue to the school, no student drop
off/pick up would be allowed on the east curb of Lubao Avenue.


There is ample street parking available in the vicinity of the school.   Lubao Avenue allows
curbside parking anytime. Curbside parking is allowed at any time on Valerio Street between
Corbin Avenue and Quakertown Avenue. During school hours, parking is prohibited on Valerio
Street between Winnetka Avenue and Quakertown.

                                     VII. PEDESTRIAN ANALYSIS




As a matter of practice, LAUSD requires that traffic studies for all school projects include a
pedestrian analysis.    In order to provide consistency with all new school traffic studies, a
pedestrian analysis for the proposed project was conducted based on the guidelines established
in the MOC that are consistent with pedestrian studies for other LAUSD projects.


The purpose of this analysis is to assess potential pedestrian safety impacts caused by the project
and to recommend potential mitigation measures, if necessary. Potential pedestrian routes in
close proximity to the school site were surveyed.




PEDESTRIAN VOLUME CALCULATIONS


The projected number of students who would walk to and from the school site was calculated by
using mode split characteristics of LAUSD schools, as established in surveys conducted for Los
Angeles Unified School District Program EIR (Meyer, Mohaddes Associates, Inc., March 2004).
This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) defines the following data for elementary school project
mode splits:


   ·   Trips by car total 55% of all trips
   ·   Trips by walking/biking total 41% of all trips
   ·   Trips via school bus, public transit, and other modes total 3% of all trips


A total project size of 650 students was used to calculate pedestrian volumes for the analysis.
Applying the mode split data summarized above, the projected number of students walking to
school would be approximately 267.




                                                  35
EXISTING PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED TRAFFIC CONTROLS


The study area was surveyed to determine the locations of existing traffic controls that could be
utilized by students to access the proposed school site from adjacent neighborhoods. Traffic
controls adjacent to the site include traffic signs, marked crosswalks, and stop-controlled
intersections.


Two of the study intersections, Winnetka Avenue/Valerio Street and Winnetka Avenue/Sherman
Way, have pedestrian signals and marked crosswalks on all approach legs. The intersection of
Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street is a four-way stop-controlled intersection with marked school
crosswalks for pedestrians traveling south and west to the school site. The intersection of Lubao
Avenue and Sherman Way southeast of the school is stop-controlled for southbound traffic and
uncontrolled for eastbound and westbound traffic. A marked school crosswalk is available for
pedestrian traffic traveling along the north side of Sherman Way to cross Lubao Avenue.


Although not a study intersection, it should be noted that the stop-controlled intersection at
Winnetka Avenue and Leadwell Street is a Smart Crosswalk with flashing beacons activated by
passive pedestrian sensors along both the northbound and southbound approaches. A crossing
guard is currently utilized to assist students in crossing this intersection.




RECOMMENDED PEDESTRIAN ROUTES


Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that pedestrians be encouraged to use the
routes shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the a.m. peak hour pedestrian volumes for the project.
Students accessing the project site from the west beyond Winnetka Avenue should be
encouraged to utilize traffic signals on Winnetka Avenue at Sherman Way and the crossing
at Winnetka Avenue and Leadwell Street, which has the crossing guard.                     Students
accessing the project site from the east beyond Lubao Street should be encouraged to
utilize marked school crossings at Lubao Avenue/Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue/Valerio
Street. Students accessing the project site from the south beyond Sherman Way should be
encouraged to use the signalized crossings at Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way.
Students accessing the project site from the north beyond Valerio Street should be
encouraged to use the signalized crossing at Winnetka Avenue and Valerio Street and

existing marked school crossings at Quakertown Avenue and Lubao Avenue. Students
should be prohibited or discouraged from crossings at locations without pedestrian or traffic
controls.




RECOMMENDED PEDESTRIAN SAFETY MEASURES


The marked school crossings at Lubao Avenue/Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue/Valerio
Street are candidates for possible future improvements. Signage and crosswalks currently
mark the school crossings. Installation of Smart Pedestrian Warning Devices is proposed at
these crossings. LADOT has established two criteria to determine the need for the installation
of these devices at uncontrolled intersection approaches.


The first criterion is a series of minimum requirements for continuing with the needs evaluation.
These requirements include:


   ·   Design requirements (crosswalk does or would meet current requirements)

   ·   Crosswalk location (crosswalk is not or would not be located within 200 feet of a railroad
       crossing or 300 feet of a flashing yellow beacon)

   ·   Average daily traffic (vehicular volume must exceed 10,000 daily vehicles)

   ·   Roadway width (width of crossed roadway is at least 40 feet)

The average daily traffic for Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street does not exceed 10,000 daily
vehicles and the crossed roadway width along both streets is less than 40 feet; therefore,
neither of the intersections at Lubao Avenue currently meets all the minimum requirements for
continuing the needs evaluation.


Although the intersection at Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street does not meet Smart Pedestrian
Warning Device minimum criteria, marked school crosswalks on the north side of Valerio Street
and on the east side of Lubao Avenue are needed.            Furthermore, this would be an ideal
location to place a crossing guard, especially since all vehicular school traffic will be flowing
through this intersection for drop-off purposes.

The preliminary analysis and recommendation within this report section shall be considered as
part of the environmental review process only.       It should be noted that pedestrian-related
improvements would need to be refined and revised as needed to ensure that the improvements
are based on an analysis of more specific operation data rather than the planning data utilized in
this report. LAUSD should take the following actions prior to the opening of the school, where
necessary:


   1. LAUSD's School Traffic and Safety Education Section should coordinate with LADOT's
      Citywide Traffic Control Programs Section for the preparation of a final pedestrian route
      map. As part of the "Pedestrian Routes to School" program, parents and students shall be
      notified to use the existing traffic safeguards.

   2. LAUSD should contact LADOT and City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering to
      coordinate the installation of appropriate traffic controls, school warning and speed limit
      signs, school crosswalks, and pavement markings.

   3. LAUSD should coordinate with the City of Los Angeles for the installation of passenger
      loading zone signage. A sign noting "School Bus Loading Only" should be placed in the
      school bus loading area. The precise locations and lengths of the restricted parking zones
      would be determined by LAUSD.

   4. After occupancy of the school, a study should be conducted for the assignment of crossing
      guards at designated intersections, as needed, to enhance pedestrian safety.

             VIII. REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS




Additional investigations were conducted to comply with the requirements in the Los Angeles
County 2002 Congestion Management Program (CMP).             The Transportation Impact Analysis
(TIA) section in the CMP describes the threshold criteria used to identify potential CMP monitoring
locations that should be included in the traffic analysis. Based on the CMP criteria, the following
locations must be analyzed:


   ·   Mainline freeway monitoring locations where a project will add 150 or more trips, in
       either direction, during either a.m. or p.m. weekday peak hours.

   ·   All CMP arterial monitoring intersections, including freeway on- and off-ramp intersections,
       where a proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the a.m. or p.m. weekday
       peak hours (of adjacent street traffic).



CMP FREEWAY ANALYSIS


The mainline freeway monitoring location nearest to the project site is the Ventura Freeway
(US-101) at Winnetka Avenue. Based on the a.m. peak hour project trip generation, the project
would generate 384 total trips. Applying the distribution pattern to the trip estimates, fewer than
150 trips (39% of the project a.m. peak hour trips) in either direction during the weekday a.m.
peak hour would travel through this CMP freeway monitoring station. Therefore, no further CMP
freeway analysis would be required.




CMP ARTERIAL INTERSECTION ANALYSIS


The nearest CMP arterial monitoring location is found at the intersection of Winnetka Avenue
and Victory Boulevard. The 50-trip CMP analysis threshold represents approximately 13% of
the 384 trips generated by the project during the a.m. peak hour. Based on the project trip
distribution pattern shown in Figure 7, the number of trips added to the monitoring intersection




                                                41
does not exceed the 50-trip threshold established by the CMP. Therefore, no further CMP
arterial intersection analysis would be required.

                              IX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS




This report documents the assumptions, methodologies, and findings of a study conducted by
Kaku Associates, Inc. to evaluate the potential traffic and circulation impacts of the proposed
project as part of the preparation of an EIR. The following summarizes the findings of the study:


     ·   Four intersections in the study area were analyzed for the project. Currently, three of the
         four intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) during
         the morning peak hour.

     ·   The project would consist of an elementary school for grades K-5.           The project is
         expected to generate 384 net new morning peak hour trips.

     ·   Analysis of the year 2010 cumulative base conditions, representing future conditions
         without the project, indicates that two of the analyzed intersections would operate at LOS
         D or better during the morning peak hours.

     ·   Analysis of the cumulative plus project conditions indicates that, using the City of Los
         Angeles criteria for determining significance of impact, the project would have significant
         impacts at two of the four analyzed intersections during the morning peak hour, including
         Winnetka Avenue at Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue at Sherman Way.

     ·   The City has requested the following improvements be included as conditions of project
         approval:

           1) Signal modifications at Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way - The intersection of
              Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant
              level with the design and construction of left-turn phasing at this intersection. This
              measure will improve the overall operation of the intersection by reducing left-turn
              queuing, and therefore will serve to mitigate the impacts at this intersection.

           2) Striping addition at Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue - The intersection of Lubao
              Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level by
              providing striping for one southbound left-turn lane and one southbound right-turn
              lane.

           3) Highway Dedications and Improvement at Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street -
              Lubao Avenue is a designated local street in the Streets and Highways Element of
              the City's General Plan, and consists of a 22-foot half roadway with a soft shoulder
              and no sidewalk on a 30-foot half right-of-way. Construction of curb, gutter and
              sidewalk along the adjacent frontage will bring this section of Lubao Avenue up to
              the standard required by the General Plan, with a 18-foot half-roadway on a 30-
              foot half right-of-way. In addition, Valerio Street is a designated collector street in


                                                43
         the General Plan, and consists of a 20-foot half roadway with existing curb, gutter
         and sidewalk on a 30-foot half right-of-way. A two-foot dedication is required to
         bring the adjacent frontage of Valerio Street up to the standard required by the
         General Plan, with a 22-foot half roadway on a 32-foot half right-of-way.

      4) Site Access and Internal Circulation - LAUSD has to ensure all loading and
         unloading of students be accomplished on site and shown on the site plan and all
         driveways be designed in accordance with City's standards.

·   Although all of the study intersections contain marked school crosswalks, one
    improvement for Lubao Avenue and Valerio Street is suggested.

·   Analysis of potential impacts on the regional transportation system conducted in
    accordance with CMP requirements determined that the project would not have a
    significant impact on the regional freeway system.

From:            Sergio D. Valdez, Transportation Engineer
                 Department of Transportation

Subject:         TRAFFIC ASSESSMENT FOR THE PROPOSED VALLEY REGION ELEMENTARY
                 SCHOOL #10 AT 7330 WINNETKA AVENUE.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has completed the traffic assessment for the proposed Valley
Region Elementary School #10 located at 7330 Winnetka Avenue, at the intersection of Lubao Avenue and
Valerio Street. This traffic assessment is based on a traffic study prepared by KAKU Associates submitted
on July 18, 2006. After careful review of the pertinent data, DOT has determined that the traffic study
adequately describes the project related traffic impacts of the proposed development.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

The proposed project consists of a 650-seat public elementary school, grades K-5, to be included in the
Los Angeles Unified School District system. This site is presently occupied by Sutter Middle School. The
proposed project will generate 384 a.m. peak hour trips as shown in Table 1 below. The trip generation
estimates are based on formulas based upon a Memorandum of Cooperation between DOT and LAUSD
signed June 24, 2005.

The traffic study reviewed four intersections for traffic impacts.

DOT's policy on significant transportation impact thresholds is summarized in Table 2. DOT has
determined that the proposed project will have a significant traffic impact at two of the studied intersections
as shown in Table 3, which is a summary of the volume-to-capacity ratios and levels of service at the study
intersections. The Department of Transportation recommends that the following Project Requirements be
adopted as conditions of project approval in order to mitigate the project's traffic impact to less than
significant levels.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

A.    Winnetka Avenue/Sherman Way Signal Modifications: Addition of left turn phasing
      The intersection of Winnetka Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant
      level through the design and construction of left turn phasing at this intersection. This measure will
      improve the overall operation of the intersection by reducing left turn queuing, and therefore will serve
      to mitigate the impacts at this intersection.

B.    Striping Addition: Sherman Way and Lubao Avenue
      The intersection of Lubao Avenue and Sherman Way will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level
      by providing striping for one southbound left turn lane and one southbound right turn lane.

      The Above transportation improvements shall be guaranteed through the B-permit process of the
Emily Gabel-Luddy                                             2                                             September 27, 2006

      Bureau of Engineering (BOE) before the issuance of any building permit for this project. These
      measures shall be completed to the satisfaction of DOT and BOE prior to the issuance of any
      certificate of occupancy. Prior to setting the bond amount, BOE shall require that the developer's
      engineer or contractor contact DOT's B-Permit Coordinator at (213) 928-9663, to arrange a pre-design
      meeting to finalize the design for the required transportation improvements.

C.    Highway Dedications and Improvements
      1.    Lubao Avenue is a designated local street in the Streets and Highways Element of the City's
            General Plan, and consists of a 22-foot half roadway with a soft shoulder and no sidewalk on a
            30-foot half right-of-way. Standard Plan S-470-0, effective November 10, 1999, dictates that the
            standard cross section for a local street is a 18-foot half-roadway on a 30-foot half right-of-way.
            Construction of curb, gutter and sidewalk along adjacent frontage will bring this section of Lubao
            Avenue up to the standard required by the General Plan.
      2.    Valerio Street is a designated collector street in the General Plan, and consists of a 20-foot half
            roadway with existing curb, gutter and sidewalk on a 30-foot half right-of-way. Standard Plan S-
            470-0 dictates that the standard cross section of a collector street is a 22-foot half roadway on a
            32-foot half right-of-way. A two-foot dedication is required to bring the adjacent frontage of
            Valerio Street up to the standard required by the General Plan.

      The applicant should contact BOE to determine exact dedication and widening standards and to
      ensure compliance of these requirements of the municipal code. The applicant should contact BOE to
      determine any other required street improvements.

      All required street improvements shall be guaranteed through the B-permit process of BOE before the
      issuance of any building permit for this project. These measures shall be completed to the satisfaction
      of DOT and BOE prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy.

D.    Site Access and Internal Circulation
      This determination does not include final approval of the project's driveways, internal circulation, and
      parking scheme. However, the following general comments do apply:
      1.    All loading and unloading of students shall be accomplished on site and shown on the site plan.
      2.    All driveways shall be designed in accordance with BOE Standard Plan S-440-3, and shall be
            designed using case 2, unless exception is given by DOT or BOE.
      3.    Two-way driveways shall be 30 feet wide and one-way driveways shall be 16 feet wide, exclusive
            of side slopes.
      4.    To minimize conflict between vehicles using adjoining driveways, a minimum of 50-feet of full-
            height curb shall be provided between driveways.

Final DOT approval shall be obtained prior to issuance of any building permits. This should be
accomplished by submitting a detailed site and/or driveway plan, at a scale of at least 1´´ = 40´, to DOT's
Valley Development Review Section at 6262 Van Nuys Boulevard, Suite 320, Van Nuys, 91401, prior to
submittal of building plans for plan check to the Department of Building and Safety.
