Gibson Transportation Consulting, Inc. was asked to analyze the potential transportation impacts
of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza Redevelopment Project (the âProjectâ). The following section
summarizes the results of this analysis.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The Project is located at 3650 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (the âProject Siteâ). It currently
holds the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza regional shopping mall, which comprises a total of
approximately 737,361 square feet (sf) of leasable shopping center space (including anchor
stores and various retail stores within the enclosed mall and various outbuildings including banks,
restaurants, fast food, and other small retail stores), 155,705 sf of non-leasable shopping center
space (mall common area and service areas), a 75,000 sf, 4,051-seat multiplex theater, a 44,052
sf grocery store, and a 4,623 sf office. Total building area is approximately 1,016,741 sf. There
are currently a total of 3,235 parking spaces within surface lots and parking structures.


The Project would renovate the existing site and add retail and entertainment uses, a hotel, and
residential uses to create an urban mixed-use development. It would include a maximum of 400
hotel rooms, 961 residential dwelling units, 148,000 sf of general office, a 75,000 sf, 2,823-seat
multiplex theater, a 50,000 sf fitness center, an 85,000 sf grocery store, 978,251 sf of leasable
shopping center space, and 155,705 sf of non-leasable shopping center space. Total building
area is approximately 1,491,956 sf outside of the hotel and residential space. It would provide
6,550 parking spaces in surface lots and parking structures. The transportation goal of the Project
is to develop an urban village and a walkable neighborhood. The Project would be constructed by
year 2020.




                                                                                               ES-1
PROJECT LOCATION AND STUDY AREA


The Project Site is located in the Crenshaw/Baldwin Hills area of the City of Los Angeles. It is
approximately 1.5 miles south of the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), approximately 3 miles west of
the Harbor Freeway (I-110), and approximately 3.5 miles northeast of the San Diego Freeway (I-
405). The Project Site is on the west side of Crenshaw Boulevard and is bisected by Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard into two parcels â the North Area and the South Area.


The Project study area (the âStudy Areaâ) includes a geographic area approximately five miles
(north-south) by approximately four miles (east-west). This approximately 20 square-mile Study
Area, established in consultation with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), is
generally bounded by Washington Boulevard to the north, Normandie Avenue to the east,
Florence Avenue to the south, and La Cienega Boulevard to the west. It was designed to ensure
that all potentially significantly impacted intersections, prior to mitigation, were analyzed.


A total of 55 intersections within the Study Area were selected for detailed analysis. Of the 55
study intersections, 45 are in the City of Los Angeles exclusively, four are common to the City of
Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles, five are in the County of Los Angeles exclusively,
and one is in the City of Inglewood. Additionally, three of the study intersections are freeway
ramp locations and share jurisdiction between the City of Los Angeles and the California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans).




ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY AND SCENARIOS


The study intersections were analyzed using the âCritical Movement Analysis (CMA) â Planningâ
(Transportation Research Circular No. 212, Interim Materials on Highway Capacity,
Transportation Research Board, 1980) methodology using LADOTâs Calcadb Lite software. The
CMA methodology calculates the volume to capacity (V/C) ratio of an intersection which is
translated into the intersection operating condition, or level of service (LOS), measured on a
scale from LOS A at nearly free-flow conditions to LOS F at capacity overflow. Significant traffic
impacts were measured according to a sliding scale in which the minimum allowable increase in
the V/C ratio as a result of Project traffic decreases as the intersection LOS worsens.




                                                                                                 ES-2
The following traffic scenarios have been developed and analyzed as part of this study:


   ï·   Existing Conditions (Year 2011) â The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a
       basis for the assessment of existing and future traffic conditions with the addition of

EXISTING CONDITIONS


The analysis of existing conditions within the Study Area establishes a baseline of current
operating conditions, on which the existing and future project analysis is based. The existing
conditions analysis included reviewing traffic volumes and current intersection operating
conditions as well as a study of the existing street network and public transit system. At LADOTâs
direction, all intersections within the City of Los Angeles were assumed to operate under the
Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system, for which a V/C credit of 0.07 is
provided during analysis.




                                                                                               ES-3
Turning movement counts were conducted at the 55 study intersections in years 2008 and 2009.
The traffic volumes were increased by an ambient growth rate of 0.5% per year to represent year
2011 conditions, though recent economic trends have actually led to a general decrease in traffic
volumes in year 2011 as compared with the years in which the traffic counts were conducted. The
traffic counts were conducted during the typical weekday morning (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.) and
afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods as well as the Saturday midday (12:00 p.m. to
3:00 p.m.) peak period.


The Existing Conditions analysis indicates that 43 intersections during the weekday morning peak
hour, 47 intersections during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 54 intersections during the
Saturday midday peak hour currently operate at LOS D or better. The remaining intersections
operate at LOS E or F.


Public transit service in the vicinity of the Project Site is provided by the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and LADOT Downtown Area Shuttle (DASH) transit
systems. The Metro bus system provides 27 bus lines in the form of both rapid and local service
in the area, and LADOT Dash provides three local bus lines. Currently, there is surplus capacity
on the transit system of approximately 507 riders during the morning peak hour, 625 riders during
the afternoon peak hour, and 192 riders during the Saturday midday peak hour.




FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT CONDITIONS


The Future without Project traffic volume forecasts for the year 2020 were developed by
accounting for growth in traffic over existing conditions from two sources â ambient growth and
related projects.   Ambient traffic growth is expected increases in traffic levels as a result of
regional growth and development, and was estimated to be approximately 0.5% per year. The
total adjustment, compounded annually over the nine-year period from existing conditions (year
2011) to full buildout (year 2020), was 4.59%.


Related Projects are other developments either proposed, approved, or under construction in the
Study Area and expected to be implemented prior to the buildout date of the Project. A total of 39
Related Projects were identified by LADOT to fit these criteria. Traffic from these projects was
estimated through a process of trip generation, trip distribution, and trip assignment through the



                                                                                              ES-4
street system. By adding the ambient growth and related projects to the existing traffic volumes,
the Future without Project traffic volumes were produced.


In addition to the growth in traffic expected between year 2011 and year 2020, various changes to
the roadway network and the intersections themselves are expected within the project horizon.
The Metro Expo Light Rail Transit (LRT) line opened along Exposition Boulevard in 2012, and is
expected to be extended to Santa Monica by year 2015. The Metro Crenshaw LRT is proposed
to be built along Crenshaw Boulevard adjacent to the site by year 2018, including a station at the
intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. A number of study
intersections would have modified lane configurations as a result of planned improvements and
the construction of the two LRT projects. Finally, before the Project is complete, LADOT expects
to upgrade all City of Los Angeles intersections within the Study Area from the ATSAC system to
the Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS), for which a V/C credit of 0.10 is provided during
analysis.


The Future without Project Conditions analysis indicates that 39 intersections during the weekday
morning peak hour, 39 intersections during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 48
intersections during the Saturday midday peak hour would operate at LOS D or better. The
remaining intersections would operate at LOS E or F.



PROJECT TRIP GENERATION AND TRIP DISTRIBUTION


The number of trips expected to be generated by the Project was estimated based on the trip
generation rates established in Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers,
2012). Adjustments accounting for non-automotive modes of travel including walking and transit
were applied to some of the proposed Project land uses. Additionally, adjustments were made
accounting for pass-by trips, or those patrons who were already driving in the Project vicinity and
divert from their routes to patronize the Project, as well as to account for internal capture, trips
made from one land use to another within the Project Site.


The Project is expected to generate a net total of 13,484 daily trips on a typical weekday,
including approximately 874 morning peak hour trips (446 inbound, 428 outbound) and 1,294




                                                                                                ES-5
afternoon peak hour trips (635 inbound, 659 outbound), and approximately 1,229 Saturday
midday peak hour trips (608 inbound, 621 outbound).


Project traffic and Interim Project traffic were distributed through the street network and to the
regional transportation system using a pattern derived from the results of a zip code survey
conducted at the Project Site in year 2004.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Existing with Project conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways, and intersection
configurations that exist today (year 2011) with full development of the Project. The Existing with
Project Conditions analysis indicates that 42 intersections during the weekday morning peak hour,
41 intersections during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 53 intersections during the
Saturday midday peak hour would operate at LOS D or better. The remaining intersections would
operate at LOS E or F.


Under Existing with Project conditions, the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at
five intersections during the morning peak hour, 11 intersections during the afternoon peak hour,
and eight intersections during the Saturday midday peak hour. A total of 14 of the 55 study
intersections are expected to be impacted during one or more peak hours. The remaining 41
intersections would not be significantly impacted.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Future with Project conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways, and intersection
configurations that would exist in the future (year 2020) with full development of the Project. The
Future with Project Conditions analysis indicates that 38 intersections during the weekday
morning peak hour, 37 intersections during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 45
intersections during the Saturday midday peak hour would operate at LOS D or better. The
remaining intersections would operate at LOS E or F.




                                                                                                ES-6
Under Future with Project conditions, the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at
eight intersections during the morning peak hour, 14 intersections during the afternoon peak hour,
and 13 intersections during the Saturday midday peak hour.          A total of 17 of the 55 study
intersections are expected to be impacted during one or more peak hours. The remaining 38
intersections would not be significantly impacted.




TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM


The Project would implement a transportation improvement and mitigation program consisting of
transit and mobility system improvements and Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
improvements. Collectively, these measures serve to improve traffic movement in the Study Area
improve intersection operations at locations projected to be impacted by Project traffic.




Transit and Mobility System Improvements


The Project would purchase and support a new bus for Metro Route 210, which travels north and
south on Crenshaw Boulevard through the Study Area. It is estimated that this has the ability to
reduce as many as 40 peak hour person-trips from the bus route. By applying a typical auto
occupancy of 1.20 person per automobile, this translates to a reduction of 33 automobiles in each
direction during the peak hours.


Additionally, the Project would allocate space and funding for a mobility hub on the Project Site.
This hub would provide secure bicycle storage, shuttle services, and vehicle sharing programs
to help further the transportation goals of the Project and the City of Los Angeles. Finally, the
Project would contribute $100,000 toward the implementation of the 2010 Bicycle Plan, A
Component of the City of Los Angeles Transportation Element (Los Angeles Department of City
Planning, adopted March 1, 2011), which proposes to implement bicycle lanes, bicycle routes,
and bicycle-friendly features on streets in the Study Area.


Per Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Section 12.26-J, the Project is required to provide and
maintain a transportation demand management (TDM) program for the office portion of the
Project and for employees of the remaining Project land uses. Consistent with LAMC



                                                                                              ES-7
requirements for a development in excess of 100,000 square feet of gross floor area, the TDM
program will provide a bulletin board or kiosk with transportation-related information, designated
carpool and vanpool parking spaces, and safe pedestrian and bicycle circulation from the
surrounding streets to the Project buildings and bicycle parking facilities.




Transportation Systems Management Improvements


The Project would implement several TSM improvements recommended by LADOT within the
Study Area.     These would include signal controller upgrades from the old Type 170 signal
controller to the new Type 2070 controller, enabling enhanced and real-time operation of signal
timing; installation of closed circuit television cameras at strategic locations to help monitor traffic
operations and respond to incidents; and the installation of advance detection loops in the street
pavement to help determine the appropriate signal timing for an intersection.             LADOT has
determined that the TSM improvements would improve traffic operations and increase intersection
capacity by approximately 1% (a 0.01 improvement in V/C ratio) along affected corridors.




Specific Intersection Improvements


The Project considered intersection improvements at several study intersections, but ultimately
those improvements were rejected due to secondary impacts deemed less desirable than the
improvements themselves.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT WITH MITIGATION CONDITIONS


The proposed mitigation program is expected to mitigate three of the five weekday morning peak
hour intersection impacts, two of the 11 weekday afternoon peak hour intersection impacts, and
three of the eight Saturday midday peak hour intersection impacts under Existing with Project with
Mitigation conditions. Overall, five of the 14 impacted intersections would be mitigated below the
level of significance by the proposed mitigation program, and nine residual significant impacts
would remain.




                                                                                                    ES-8
FUTURE WITH PROJECT WITH MITIGATION CONDITIONS


The proposed mitigation program is expected to mitigate five of the eight weekday morning peak
hour intersection impacts, five of the 14 weekday afternoon peak hour intersection impacts, and
six of the 13 Saturday midday peak hour intersection impacts under Future with Project with
Mitigation conditions. Overall, seven of the 17 impacted intersections would be mitigated below
the level of significance by the proposed mitigation program, and 10 residual significant impacts
would remain.




CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (CMP) ANALYSIS


An analysis of the regional transportation facilities in the vicinity of the Project was conducted in
accordance with the traffic impact analysis (TIA) procedures outlined in the 2010 Congestion
Management Program (Metro, 2010). The CMP requires that a TIA be performed for all arterial
monitoring intersections where a project would add 50 or more trips during either the morning or
afternoon weekday peak hour and all mainline freeway monitoring locations where a project would
add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours. It
also requires a review of the future transit capacity after implementation of a project.




CMP Intersection Analysis


The Project is expected to add 50 or more peak hour trips to one designated arterial monitoring
intersection (Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue). However, under Future with Project
conditions, that location is not projected to operate at LOS F and therefore, under CMP
significant impact criteria, is not significantly impacted. Therefore, the Project is not expected to
result in a significant traffic impact at any CMP arterial monitoring intersections.




                                                                                                 ES-9
CMP Freeway Analysis


The Project is not expected to add 150 or more peak hour trips in either direction to the nearest
freeway mainline monitoring location.      Therefore, the Project is not expected to result in a
significant traffic impact at any CMP freeway monitoring location.



CMP Transit Analysis


An analysis of the existing and future transit system was conducted based on the residual
capacity in the existing transit system in the Project vicinity and projected transit usage growth
over the years until Project buildout. The transit system is projected in year 2020 to have
residual capacity of 419 transit patrons during the morning peak hour and 547 transit patrons in
the afternoon peak hour.


The Project is estimated to add a total of 4,056 daily transit trips, including 287 morning peak
hour trips and 393 afternoon peak hour trips, at full buildout. This is less than the existing and
projected future residual transit capacity and, therefore, the Project is not expected to result in a
significant impact on the regional transit system.




PARKING


The Project Site currently provides a total of 3,235 off-street parking spaces between surface
parking lots and parking decks. The Project proposes to provide a total of 6,550 parking spaces,
including 4,550 for the commercial land uses on the Project Site and 2,000 spaces for the
residential land uses.


The parking requirements for the Project were estimated using required rates from the Los
Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) (City of Los Angeles, revised February 4, 2010). By applying
the correct parking rates to each land use, the LAMC requires a total of 1,968 parking spaces for
residential uses and 4,615 spaces for commercial uses, which is less than the proposed supply.




                                                                                                ES-10
A shared parking analysis was also conducted for the commercial land uses on the Project Site to
determine the projected peak parking demand, taking into account the various time-of-day and
month-of-year demand variations of each land use. The shared parking analysis indicated that, in
a typical month (June), there would be a peak demand of 4,367 spaces on a weekday and 4,476
spaces on a Saturday. During the peak month (December), there would be a peak demand of
5,551 spaces on a weekday and 5,677 spaces on a Saturday. During a typical month, the
proposed 4,550 spaces for commercial uses on the Project Site would be sufficient to
accommodate demand. During the peak month of December, the proposed parking supply would
be insufficient to meet parking demand by up to 1,127 spaces.


To accommodate demand during the peak shopping season in December, the Project will institute
an operational parking program that will include measures such as tandem and off-site parking for
employees, valet parking for customers, and encouraging employees to rideshare or use transit
during December.




SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION


The Project would include a total of 12 entry driveways, two of which would be new as part of the
Project. Internal vehicular circulation would remain largely unchanged. Pedestrian circulation
would be improved by increasing access through the property boundaries, widening pedestrian
walkways, street furniture and bus shelters along the Project periphery, and striped and signalized
pedestrian crosswalks linking the land uses. The pedestrian bridge over Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard linking the North Area and the South Area would be retained so patrons can park in
one area and walk between both.


According to L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide: Your Resource for Preparing CEQA Analyses in Los
Angeles (City of Los Angeles, 2006) (L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide), a project would have a
significant access impact if the intersection(s) nearest the primary site access is/are projected to
operate at LOS E or F during the peak hours under Future with Project conditions. Three Project
access driveways would be significantly impacted under these criteria, both before and after
implementation of the Project mitigation program. No safety impacts are expected to occur.




                                                                                               ES-11
NEIGHBORHOOD INTRUSION IMPACT ANALYSIS


LADOT policy and the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide outline a procedure for assessing the
potential for neighborhood intrusion impacts (i.e., residential neighborhood cut-through traffic) if
the following three conditions are met:


   1. There must be 1,200 or more daily trips added by a Project to an arterial corridor.

   2. There must be congestion on the arterial corridor (determined by intersections operating
      at LOS E or F)

   3. There must be parallel local residential streets providing a cut-through route.


Even when the above criteria are met, it is impossible to definitively predict where and to what
extent neighborhood cut-through traffic will occur as the result of a project. Therefore, the
above criteria are used to identify neighborhoods that could potentially be impacted and as
mitigation the Applicant is required to set aside funds that can be used after Project completion,
at the request of an identified community, to assess whether cut-through traffic has occurred
and, with community input and approval, to develop specific corrective measures.


Following these criteria, six neighborhoods were identified in the Project vicinity as potentially
impacted. As mitigation for these potential significant impacts, the Applicant will set aside an
amount to be determined by the Applicant and LADOT to fund and coordinate implementation of
a Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan for the Project. Upon request from any of the six
identified neighborhoods, the Applicant will use the designated funds to assess whether impacts
are occurring and plan corrective measures.




CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS


An analysis was conducted to determine whether the level of traffic generated by construction
activities would result in temporary traffic impacts to the street system.      Construction traffic
includes worker traffic and haul truck traffic. Because a significant portion of the existing Project
Site would be closed and demolished during construction activity, the net effect of Project




                                                                                                ES-12
construction activity will be a reduction in traffic levels. Thus, no operational impacts are expected
to occur at any study intersection.


However, construction activities at the periphery of the Project Site could have temporary impacts
on streets, transit facilities, and pedestrian facilities, including closure or temporary removal of
such facilities. The Project would develop detailed construction traffic management plans in order
to minimize the effect of Project construction on the surrounding environment.




PROJECT ALTERNATIVES


Several alternatives to the proposed Project were considered as part of this analysis. Alternative
2 proposes to build up the Project Site according to the existing zoning under the Cityâs General
Plan. Alternative 3 is a reduction of the proposed Project by 25%. Alternative 4 is a reduction of
the proposed Project by 50%. Alternative 5 proposes an alternative land use plan consisting of
additional office development and reduced residential development.


Alternative 2 would produce approximately 18% fewer trips than the proposed Project. It is
expected that it would result in eight residual significant impacts after implementation of the
proposed mitigation, three fewer than with construction of the Project.


Alternative 3 would produce approximately 25% fewer trips than the proposed Project. It is
expected that it would result in seven residual significant intersection impacts after implementation
of the proposed mitigation program, four fewer than with construction of the Project.


Alternative 4 would produce approximately 50% fewer trips than the proposed Project. It is
expected that it would result in four residual significant impacts after implementation of the
proposed mitigation program, seven fewer than with construction of the Project.


Alternative 5 would produce slightly more trips overall than the proposed Project. It is expected
that it would result in 11 residual significant impacts after implementation of the proposed
mitigation program, the same number and locations as with construction of the proposed Project.




                                                                                                 ES-13

                                                                               Introduction


The transportation analysis presented in this study has been prepared to evaluate the potential
transportation impacts of the renovation and expansion of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza
Redevelopment Project (the âProjectâ). The methodology and base assumptions used in this
analysis were established in conjunction with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation
(LADOT) according to Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (LADOT, August 2011).




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The Project is located on an approximately 43-acre site at 3650 Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard, west of Crenshaw Boulevard between 39th Street and Stocker Street in the
Crenshaw/Baldwin Hills area of the City of Los Angeles (the âProject Siteâ). The Project Site is
bounded by 39th Street, Crenshaw Boulevard, Stocker Street, Santa Rosalia Drive, and Marlton
Avenue and is located entirely within the West Adams Community Plan Area. The Project Site
is bisected by Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard into two parcels â the North Area and the South
Area.


The Project Site currently holds the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza regional shopping mall, which
comprises a total of approximately 737,361 square feet (sf) of leasable shopping center space
(including anchor stores and various retail stores within the enclosed mall and various
outbuildings including banks, restaurants, fast food, and other small retail stores), 155,705 sf of
non-leasable shopping center space (mall common area and service areas), a 75,000 sf, 4,051-
seat multiplex theater, a 44,052 sf grocery store, and a 4,623 sf office. Total building area is
approximately 1,016,741 sf. There are currently a total of 3,235 parking spaces within surface
lots and parking structures.


The Project includes a renovation of the existing site and constituent buildings, as well as the
addition of retail and entertainment uses, a hotel, and residential uses to create an urban mixed-



                                                                                                 1
                                                                                                  1
use development designed to serve the local community. The Project Site is located in an area
of high transit service and usage. The transportation goal of the Project is to develop an urban
village and a walkable neighborhood that would provide for alternatives to making trips by
automobiles â by providing mixed land uses, access to transit and opportunities for walking to
destinations â and thereby generate lower levels of automotive trip-making.


A horizon year of 2020 was selected for the study to coincide with Projectâs proposed completion.
Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual site plan of the Project Site at full buildout. The Project would
include renovation and redevelopment of the Project Site with a maximum of 400 hotel rooms
with associated restaurant and meeting spaces, 961 residential dwelling units, 148,000 sf of
general office, a 75,000 sf, 2,823-seat multiplex theater, a 50,000 sf fitness center, an 85,000 sf
grocery store, 978,251 sf of leasable shopping center space, and 155,705 sf of non-leasable
shopping center space. Total building area is approximately 1,491,956 sf outside of the hotel
and residential space. Table 1 summarizes the preliminary building program for the Project. The
Project would provide a total of 6,550 parking spaces in surface lots and parking structures.




Project Location and Study Area


The Project Site is located approximately 1.5 miles south of the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10);
approximately 3 miles west of the Harbor Freeway (I-110); and approximately 3.5 miles
northeast of the San Diego Freeway (I-405). These freeways provide regional access to the
Project Site.   Primary local access to the Project Site is provided by a network of streets
including Crenshaw Boulevard, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and Stocker Street.             The
Project Site is located along the proposed route of Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authorityâs (Metro) planned Crenshaw Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, which
would include an underground station at the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard, directly under the Project Site.


The Project study area (the âStudy Areaâ) includes a geographic area approximately five miles
(north-south) by approximately four miles (east-west). This approximately 20 square-mile Study
Area was established in consultation with LADOT and by reviewing the travel patterns and the
potential impacts of Project traffic. It is bounded generally by Washington Boulevard to the
north, Normandie Avenue to the east, Florence Avenue to the south, and La Cienega Boulevard


                                                                                                   2
                                                                                                    2
to the west. The Study Area was designed to ensure that all potentially significantly impacted
intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed, and the boundary of the Study Area was
extended, as necessary, to confirm by reviewing the Project trafficâs travel patterns that there
were no significant impacts at or outside the boundary of the Study Area. Looking at whether
the Project traffic traversing through the intersections could result in a significant impact prior to
any mitigation, 55 intersections in the Study Area were selected for detailed analysis. Figure 2
illustrates the location of the Project Site in relation to the surrounding street system and the 55
analyzed intersections, and Table 2 lists the analyzed intersections.




STUDY SCOPE


The scope of work for this study was developed in conjunction with LADOT.                  The base
assumptions and technical methodologies were discussed as part of the study approach and
agreed to in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) dated May 17, 2012. A copy of the MOU
has been provided in Appendix A.


The study analyzed the potential Project-generated traffic impacts on the street system
surrounding the Project Site. Intersection traffic impacts for the Project were evaluated for
typical weekday morning (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.) and afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak
periods as well as the Saturday midday (12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.) peak period. The analysis of
future year traffic forecasts was conducted for full buildout of the Project and is based on
projected conditions in 2020 both with and without the addition of the Project traffic.


The following traffic scenarios have been developed and analyzed as part of this study:

   ï·   Existing Conditions (Year 2011) â The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a
       basis for the assessment of future traffic conditions. The Existing Conditions analysis
       includes a description of key area streets and highways, traffic volumes, and current
       operating conditions.

       Intersection turning movement counts for typical weekday morning (7:00 a.m. to 10:00
       a.m.) and afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) and Saturday midday (12:00 p.m. to 3:00
       p.m.) peak periods were collected in 2008 and 2009. Fieldwork (lane configurations and
       signal phasing) for the analyzed intersections was collected in December 2010. In order
       to represent year 2011 conditions, the traffic volumes were increased by an ambient
       growth rate of 0.5% per year from year 2009 to year 2011.



                                                                                                    3
                                                                                                     3
   ï·     Future without Project Conditions (Year 2020) â This analysis projects the future traffic
         growth and intersection operating conditions that could be expected as a result of
         regional growth and related projects in the vicinity of the Project Site by year 2020. This
         analysis provides the baseline future conditions by which Project impacts are evaluated
         at full buildout.

   ï·     Existing with Project Conditions, Before Mitigation (Year 2011) â This analysis identifies
         the potential incremental impacts of the Project at full buildout, prior to impact mitigation
         measures, on existing traffic operating conditions by adding the Project-generated traffic to
         the Existing traffic forecasts (year 2011). This scenario does not include the effects of
         Project mitigation.

   ï·     Existing with Project with Mitigation Conditions (Year 2011) â This analysis identifies the
         potential incremental impacts of the Project on existing traffic operating conditions by
         adding the Project-generated traffic, accounting for the Projectâs mitigation program, to the
         Existing traffic forecasts (year 2011). The Projectâs mitigation program includes system-
         wide signal system upgrades, and transit capacity improvement measures.

   ï·     Future with Project Conditions, Before Mitigation (Year 2020) â This analysis identifies
         the potential incremental impacts of the Project at full buildout, prior to impact mitigation
         measures, on projected future traffic operating conditions by adding the Project-
         generated traffic to the Future without Project traffic forecasts (year 2020). This scenario
         does not include the effects of Project mitigation.

   ï·     Future with Project with Mitigation Conditions (Year 2020) â This analysis identifies the
         potential incremental impacts of the Project on projected future traffic operating
         conditions by adding the Project-generated traffic, accounting for the Projectâs mitigation
         program, to the Future without Project traffic forecasts (year 2020). The Projectâs
         mitigation program includes system-wide signal system upgrades, and transit capacity
         improvement measures.



Intersection Capacity Analyses


Intersection capacity has been analyzed using a method that assesses the cumulative operating
conditions at each study intersection.      The âCritical Movement Analysis (CMA) â Planningâ
(Transportation Research Circular No. 212, Interim Materials on Highway Capacity,
Transportation Research Board, 1980) methodology is required by LADOT for consistency with
the 2010 Congestion Management Program (CMP) (Metro, 2010) and has been used in this
study.   The CMA methodology software (Calcadb Lite) developed by LADOT was used to
analyze the intersections.




                                                                                                    4
                                                                                                     4
Significant Impact Criteria


LADOT has established threshold criteria used to determine the significant traffic impact of a
proposed project on the signalized study intersections. LADOT standards indicate that a project
is considered to have a significant traffic impact on a signalized intersection if the increase in the
volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio attributable to the project exceeds a specific standard depending
on the final intersection level of service (LOS). The significant impact criteria for signalized
intersections identified in L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide: Your Resource for Preparing CEQA
Analyses in Los Angeles (City of Los Angeles, 2006) (L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide) is
consistent with the LADOT criteria.


LADOT has developed a sliding scale in which the minimum allowable increase in the V/C ratio
decreases as the LOS worsens:

                Intersection Conditions          Significant Impact Threshold for
                   with Project Traffic              Project-related Increase
                 LOS             V/C                        in V/C Ratio
                   C        0.701 - 0.800           Equal to or greater than 0.04
                   D        0.801 - 0.900           Equal to or greater than 0.02
                  E, F         > 0.900              Equal to or greater than 0.01

Congestion Management Program Analysis


The CMP is a State-mandated program that serves as the monitoring and analytical basis for
transportation funding decisions in the County made through the Regional Transportation
Improvement Program (RTIP) and State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) processes.
The CMP requires that a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) be performed for all CMP arterial
monitoring intersections where a project would add 50 or more trips during either the morning or
afternoon weekday peak hours and all mainline freeway monitoring locations where a project
would add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during the morning or afternoon weekday peak
hours. Additionally, it requires a review of potential impacts to the regional transit system.

STUDY INTERSECTIONS


Study intersections were selected based on Project traffic patterns and in consultation with
LADOT. The Study Area was designed to ensure that all potentially significantly impacted
intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed, and the boundary of the Study Area was
extended as necessary to confirm that there were no significant impacts at or outside the
boundary of the Study Area.       At least one intersection beyond any significantly impacted
intersection was analyzed to validate that there were no outlying impacted intersections by
reviewing the Project trafficâs travel patterns.   As a result, a total of 55 intersections were
analyzed as part of this study.


Of the 55 study intersections, 45 are in the City of Los Angeles, four are common to the City of
Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles, five are in the County of Los Angeles, and one is
in the City of Inglewood. Three of the study intersections in the City of Los Angeles are freeway
ramp locations and, thus, also fall under Caltrans jurisdiction. A list of these intersections by
jurisdiction is presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 3. The existing lane configurations
at the analyzed intersections are provided in Appendix B.




EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND OPERATING CONDITIONS


Intersection turning movement counts for the weekday morning and afternoon and Saturday
midday peak periods were collected in 2008 and 2009 for the 55 analyzed intersections. The
traffic volumes were increased by an ambient growth rate of 0.5% per year from year 2009 to
year 2011. This is a conservative approach, as recent economic trends have actually led to a




                                                                                                11
                                                                                                 14
general decrease in traffic volumes in the vicinity in year 2011 as compared with the years in
which the traffic counts were conducted.


These traffic volumes, illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, represent for the purposes of this analysis the
existing conditions. Intersection fieldwork (signal phasing and lane configurations) was collected
in December 2010. The existing intersection lane configurations and traffic counts are provided
in Appendices B and C, respectively. Peak hour volumes for the analyzed intersections in
tabular form are provided in Appendix D.




Level of Service Methodology


LOS categories range from excellent, nearly free-flow traffic at LOS A to stop-and-go conditions at
LOS F. LOS D is typically recognized as an acceptable service level in urban areas, although
many urbanized areas operate at LOS E or F.


There are a variety of standard methodologies to analyze LOS for signalized intersections.
According to LADOT policy, this study is required to utilize the CMA method of intersection
capacity calculation to analyze signalized intersections. The CMA methodology determines the
intersection V/C ratio and corresponding LOS for the turning movements and intersection
characteristics at signalized intersections based on the definitions described in Table 3.


All of the analyzed intersections are currently controlled by traffic signals. The Calcadb Lite
software package developed by LADOT was used to implement the CMA methodology at the
analyzed intersections.


One intersection, La Brea Avenue & Centinela Avenue (Intersection #42), is located within the
City of Inglewood and is subject to City of Inglewoodâs guidelines. Similarly, the nine intersections
within the County of Los Angelesâ jurisdiction are subject to the Countyâs Traffic Impact Analysis
Report Guidelines (County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works, January 1, 1997). A
supplemental analysis for these intersections has been included in Appendix E.




                                                                                                   12
                                                                                                    15
Computer Traffic Signal Control


The Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system represents an advanced
system in computer control of traffic signals. It was first put into operation in June 1984 in the
Coliseum area of the City of Los Angeles to anticipate the expected increase in traffic due to the
Summer Olympic Games, and has since been expanded to other parts of the City.                 The
advantages of ATSAC-controlled traffic signals are substantial, including real-time adjustment of
signal timing plans to reflect changing traffic conditions, identification of unusual traffic
conditions caused by incidents, the ability to implement special purpose short-term signal timing
changes in response to incidents, and the ability to identify signal equipment malfunctions
quickly. LADOT estimates that implementation of this system improves intersection capacity by
an average of 7%.


In addition to ATSAC, the Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS) has been tested and
implemented along major travel corridors in the City of Los Angeles. ATCS is a computer-
based traffic signal control program that provides fully responsive traffic signal control based on
real-time traffic conditions.   It automatically adjusts and optimizes traffic signal timing in
response to current traffic demands on the entire signal network such that the number of stops
and the amount of delay is minimized along with improved traffic signal coordination throughout
the network.    LADOT estimates that implementation of this system improves intersection
capacity by an additional 3% over those operating under the ATSAC system alone for a total of
10% credit.


For the purposes of this analysis, 48 of the 55 study intersections are assumed to currently
operate under the City of Los Angelesâ ATSAC system. A capacity increase of 7% (0.07 V/C
adjustment) was applied to reflect the benefits of ATSAC control at these intersections. The
intersections located wholly within the County of Los Angeles or the City of Inglewood do not
operate under the ATSAC or ATCS system, and received no adjustment to their V/C ratios.




Existing Intersection Operations


Existing intersection operations during the analyzed peak hours are shown in Table 4, which
summarizes the V/C ratios and corresponding LOS at each of the analyzed intersections.


                                                                                                13
                                                                                                 16
Figures 6, 7, and 8 graphically illustrate the existing weekday morning, weekday afternoon, and
Saturday midday peak hours LOS at the analyzed intersections, respectively. Detailed LOS
worksheets are provided in Appendix F.


As shown in Table 4, 43 intersections during the weekday morning peak hour, 47 intersections
during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 54 intersections during the Saturday midday peak
hour currently operate at LOS D or better. The remaining intersections operate at LOS E or F.




PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM


Bus transit service is available as part of the public transit system in the immediate vicinity of the
Project Site. Bus transit providers in the region providing service in the vicinity of the Project
Site include Metro and LADOT Downtown Area Shuttle (DASH) transit systems. The Metro bus
system provides 27 bus lines in the form of both rapid and local service in the area. The
LADOT DASH system provides three local bus lines in the area.


Figure 9 illustrates the existing transit service within the Study Area. Table 5 summarizes the
various transit lines operating within the Study Area for each of the service providers in the
region, the type of service (peak vs. off-peak, express vs. local), and frequency of service. The

                                                                                            15
                                                                                             18
   ï·   LADOT DASH Midtown â The Midtown Route is a local line that travels from the Project

       part of the Project Site on 39th Street, Marlton Avenue, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
       and Crenshaw Boulevard.

The existing ridership data, obtained from Metro and LADOT, for the primary transit lines
serving the Project Site during the morning (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.), afternoon (3:00 p.m. to
7:00 p.m.), and Saturday (12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.) peak periods is summarized in Table 6. The
ridership data was collected by Metro and LADOT in the fourth quarter of 2010. The maximum
loads summarized in the table are the maximum number of people on the line on the peak run
during the peak periods in the peak direction.      The table also summarizes the maximum
load/capacity (load factor) for each line assuming a capacity of 40 seated and 50 standing for
regular buses and 66 seated and 75 standing for articulated buses (Metro Rapid only). Using
the maximum load/capacity, the residual capacity on all lines was calculated per run and during
the peak hour.


As shown in Table 6, some lines serving the Project Site are operating at capacity during at
least one run. Table 7 shows the maximum load on the lines for two runs before the run at
capacity and two runs after the run with the maximum load. As shown in Table 7, while the lines
operate at capacity on certain runs, adequate capacity is available on all lines before and after
the maximum load run. However, for a conservative approach, residual capacity on the system
has been calculated by assuming that the lines would have the same maximum capacity for
each run during the peak hour as the maximum load during the entire peak period. A residual
capacity of 507 in the morning peak hour, 625 during the afternoon peak hour, and 192 during

                                        EXCELLENT. No vehicle waits longer than one red

                                        light and no approach phase is fully used.

                                        VERY GOOD. An occasional approach phase is fully
         B             0.601 - 0.700    utilized; many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                                        restricted within groups of vehicles.

                                        GOOD. Occasionally drivers may have to wait
         C             0.701 - 0.800    through more than one red light; backups may
                                        develop behind turning vehicles.

                                        FAIR. Delays may be substantial during portions of
                                        the rush hours, but enough lower volume periods

                                        FAILURE. Backups from nearby locations or on
                                        cross streets may restrict or prevent movement of

                                        Tremendous delays with continuously increasing
                                        queue lengths.

                                               Future without Project Conditions


In accordance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements, the Projectâs TIA
considers the effects of the Project in relation to other developments either proposed, approved,
or under construction in the Study Area. These development proposals and the methodologies
used in projecting future traffic conditions without the Project are discussed in this section. The
base year 2020 roadway network conditions in terms of anticipated supply, demand, and
operations (system performance) are also discussed in this Chapter. The study analyzed year
2020 to coincide with the projected year of full buildout of the Project.




FUTURE BASE IMPROVEMENTS


The roadway network for the Future without Project conditions (year 2020) within the Study
Area is affected by regional improvements and local planned improvements.




Metro Expo Line


Phase 1 of the Expo LRT project connects downtown Los Angeles to Culver City along Exposition
Boulevard. The Metro Expo Line is a primarily at-grade transit line which is expected to reduce
congestion along I-10 as well as provide convenient and reliable public transportation to the
densely developed neighborhoods along the Exposition Boulevard corridor. The line has a station
at the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Exposition Boulevard, approximately one-half mile
north of the Project Site.


Construction on Phase 2 of the Metro Expo Line began in 2012. It will extend the line from Culver
City to Santa Monica, completing the link between the Pacific Ocean and downtown Los Angeles.
Phase 2 is expected to open for service in year 2015. It should be noted that, although changes



                                                                                                18
                                                                                                 44
in roadway configurations due to the Metro Expo Line were accounted for in the analysis, the
future traffic projections did not take into account reduction in vehicular traffic due to an increase
in transit ridership resulting from the line.




Metro Crenshaw Line


The Metro Crenshaw LRT Line would connect El Segundo to the Metro Expo Line at Crenshaw
Boulevard, providing a link between LAX and the greater Metro transit system.             The Metro
Crenshaw Line would pass adjacent to the Project Site along Crenshaw Boulevard, with a station
at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. It would be constructed below grade adjacent to the Project
Site, though along the length of the line there would be sections at grade and elevated above
grade.


Currently, the Metro Crenshaw Line is undergoing the planning and approval process. A Draft
EIR was circulated in 2009, and community planning meetings are being held in preparation for
the eventual publishing of the Final EIR. Metro expects to complete construction of the line and
open it for service in 2018, before the projected buildout of the Project.


As with the Metro Expo Line, although changes in roadway configurations due to the Metro
Crenshaw Line were accounted for in the analysis, the future traffic projections did not take into
account reduction in vehicular traffic due to an increase in transit ridership resulting from the
line.




Intersection Improvements


A number of study intersections are scheduled to be improved, either as part of a community plan,
as a mitigation measure for another development in the vicinity, or to accommodate the two new
Metro LRT Lines discussed above. The improvements are as follows:


          ï·   Intersection #3 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard â The
              existing southbound shared through/right-turn lane will be separated into one
              through lane and one right-turn lane to provide two left-turn lanes, three through
              lanes, and one right-turn lane in the southbound direction.


                                                                                                   19
                                                                                                    45
         ï·   Intersection #15 â Crenshaw Boulevard & 48th Street â An eastbound through lane
             will be added to provide one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one shared
             through/right-turn lane in the eastbound direction.

         ï·   Intersection #16 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Slauson Avenue â The existing
             northbound exclusive right-turn lane will be removed and the outermost northbound
             through lane will become a shared through/right-turn lane. This will provide one left-
             turn lane, two through lanes, and one shared through/right-turn lane in the
             northbound direction.

         ï·   Intersection #18 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Exposition Boulevard â Exposition
             Boulevard will be modified to provide one left-turn lane, one through lane, one right-
             turn lane, and a bus-only lane in the eastbound direction, and one left-turn lane, one
             shared through/right-turn lane, and a bus-only lane in the westbound direction.

         ï·   Intersection #23 â Arlington Avenue & Rodeo Road â The existing p.m. peak period
             northbound left-turn restriction will be removed to allow northbound left-turns at all
             times.

         ï·   Intersection #33 â La Cienega Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard â La Cienega
             Boulevard will be modified to provide two left-turn lanes, three through-lanes, and
             one free-flow right-turn lane in the southbound direction and one left-turn lane, three
             through lanes, and one right-turn lane in the northbound direction.

         ï·   Intersection #34 â La Cienega Boulevard & Rodeo Road â An eastbound left-turn
             lane will be added to provide two left-turn lanes, two through lanes, and one right-
             turn lane in the eastbound direction.




Adaptive Traffic Control System


As mentioned in Chapter 2, 48 of the 55 analyzed intersections are assumed to currently
operate under the City of Los Angelesâ ATSAC system.           These 48 intersections would be
connected to the City of Los Angelesâ ATCS by the year 2020.               LADOT estimates that
implementation of this system improves intersection capacity by an additional 3% over those
operating under the ATSAC system alone. In accordance with standard LADOT procedures, a
capacity increase of 10% (0.10 V/C adjustment) was applied to reflect the benefits of ATCS
control at these intersections for all future scenarios.

FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The Future without Project traffic projections reflect growth in traffic over existing conditions from
two sources. The first source is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects increases in traffic
due to regional growth and development outside the Study Area. The second source is growth
due to traffic generated by ongoing or entitled projects in or in the vicinity of the Study Area.




Ambient Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase as a result of regional growth and development. Based
on historic trends and standard LADOT procedures, an ambient growth factor of 0.5% per year
was used to adjust the existing traffic volumes to reflect the effects of regional growth and
development by the year 2020. The total adjustment, compounded annually over the nine-year
period from the existing conditions analysis (year 2011) until full buildout of the Project (year
2020) was therefore 4.59%.




Related Projects


In accordance with CEQA requirements, this study considers the effects of the Project in
relation to other developments either proposed, approved, or under construction in the Study
Area and expected to be implemented prior to the buildout date of the Project (collectively, the
âRelated Projectsâ). The list of Related Projects was obtained from LADOT in December 2010.


A total of 39 Related Projects, illustrated in Figure 10, have been identified in relation to the
Project by way of location and completion dates comparable with the Project. Table 8 provides
information on the land use, location, size, status, and trip generation estimates of these
Related Projects. Other developments outside the Study Area have been determined to be
geographically too far from the Project Site to add substantially to the cumulative effects within
the Study Area. Traffic from other future developments that have been proposed or may be
proposed in the nine-year period to full buildout of the Project, but are not included in the
Related Projects list, is accounted for by the ambient growth rate described above.




                                                                                                    21
                                                                                                    47
The specifics regarding Related Projects compiled for this study are based on information
provided by LADOT and recent published reports for other developments. As noted above, the
trips associated with these Related Projects have been accounted for in the future forecasts
developed.


Trip Generation. Trip generation estimates for the Related Projects were calculated using a
combination of previous study findings and the trip generation rates contained in Trip
Generation, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers [ITE], 2012), a national standard
used by the traffic engineering profession.     As shown in Table 8, the Related Projects are
expected to generate a total of approximately 75,906 daily trips on a typical weekday, including
6,291 morning peak hour trips and 6,877 afternoon peak hour trips, and approximately 5,464 trips
during the Saturday midday peak hour. These projections are conservative in that they do not in
every case account for either the existing uses to be removed or the likely use of non-motorized
travel modes (transit, walk, etc.)


Trip Distribution. The geographic distribution of the traffic generated by the Related Projects is
dependent on several factors. These factors include the type and density of the proposed land
uses, the geographic distribution of population from which the employees/residents and potential
patrons of the Related Projects are drawn, and the location of these projects in relation to the
surrounding street system.


Trip Assignment. The trip generation estimates for the Related Projects were assigned to the
local street system using the trip distribution pattern described above. These volumes were then
added to the existing traffic volumes after adjustment for the 5.64% ambient growth through the
assumed buildout year of 2020. The resulting Future without Project intersections traffic volumes
are illustrated in Figures 11 and 12 for the weekday and Saturday peak hours, respectively. They
represent Future without Project conditions, i.e., future conditions without the Project in the year
2020. Peak hour traffic volumes for the analyzed intersections are provided in tabular form in
Appendix D.




                                                                                                 22

INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


This section presents the methodology and results of the intersection operations for the Future
without Project conditions that are defined by the traffic volumes, intersection lane
configurations, and roadways that would exist in year 2020 as noted above.


Similar to the existing conditions, the study intersections were analyzed using the CMA
methodology based on LADOT guidelines. The projected Future without Project intersection
operating conditions for the analyzed peak hours are shown in Table 9. Figures 13, 14, and 15
graphically illustrate the Future without Project LOS at the analyzed intersections for the
weekday morning, weekday afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.
Intersection lane configurations and detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendices B and
F, respectively.


As shown in Table 9, in the year 2020, 39 intersections during the weekday morning peak hour,
39 intersections during the weekday afternoon peak hour, and 48 intersections during the
Saturday midday peak hour are expected to operate at LOS D or better. The intersections are
projected to operate at LOS E or F.

This chapter describes the assumptions and methodology used in developing the traffic volumes
associated with the Project within the Study Area.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


As described in Chapter 1, the Project is located west of Crenshaw Boulevard between 39th
Street and Stocker Street in the Crenshaw/Baldwin Hills area of the City of Los Angeles. The
Project Site is bounded by 39th Street, Crenshaw Boulevard, Stocker Street, Santa Rosalia
Drive, and Marlton Avenue and is located entirely within the West Adams Community Plan Area.
The Project Site is bisected by Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard into two parcels â the North
Area and the South Area.


A horizon year of 2020 was selected for the study to coincide with Projectâs full buildout. Figure 1
illustrates the conceptual plan of the Project at full buildout.      The Project would include
renovation and redevelopment of the Project Site with a maximum of 400 hotel rooms with
associated restaurant and meeting spaces, 961 residential dwelling units, 148,000 sf of general
office, a 2,823-seat multiplex theater, and commercial space of up to 1,113,251 sf comprising
retail space, an enlarged supermarket, and a fitness center. Table 1 summarizes the preliminary
building program for the Project. The Project would provide a total of 6,550 parking spaces in
surface lots and parking structures.



PROJECT TRIP GENERATION


Trip Generation, 9th Edition was used to estimate the number of trips expected to be generated
by the Project and the existing land uses on the Project Site. The trip generation estimates for
the shopping center land use were applied only to the leasable area of the shopping center,



                                                                                                 25
                                                                                                  72
consistent with ITE guidance.        Adjustments accounting for non-automotive modes of travel
including walking and transit were applied to the trip generation estimates for the different land
uses.     These adjustments, in accordance with LADOT policy, are standard for densely
developed neighborhoods with high transit availability and have been used for other Los
Angeles developments.


Three different types of trip credits were applied to the trip generation rates:

   ï·     Transit/Walk Credit: This credit accounts for non-automotive modes of travel to and from
         the site, including public transit, bicycling, and walking.


   ï·     Pass-by Credit: A pass-by trip is a patron who is already driving in the Project vicinity
         and simply diverts from his/her route to patronize the Project. These are not new trips
         added to the area, and, thus, their effect on the local traffic due to the Project is limited to
         the diverted portion of their route. Pass-by trips are included in Project trip totals at
         intersections adjacent to the Project Site, but are not included (i.e., a credit is taken) at
         all other study intersections.


   ï·     Internal Capture Credit: Internal capture in a development with multiple types of land
         uses accounts for trips made from one land use to another within the Project Site. Often
         a patron who comes to see a movie will also have dinner or stop by a store to purchase
         an item.   These trips do not use the local street network and account for both an
         outbound trip from one land use and an inbound trip to another land use within the Site.


Three primary sources were reviewed as part of the process of establishing the trip reduction
factors: LADOTâs traffic study guidelines and two empirical surveys of existing patrons at
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. LADOTâs traffic study guidelines allow up to a 25% transit and
walk-in credit for developments that are located adjacent to a transit station, and up to 15% if
located within a quarter-mile of a transit station or Rapid bus stop. The guidelines also allow a
10% pass-by trip credit for large shopping center uses and a 40% pass-by trip credit for grocery
store uses.     While there are no specific guidelines on accounting for internal trip capture
between different land uses on the site, these credits are to be considered on a case-by-case
basis.




                                                                                                      26
                                                                                                       73
The first shopper survey, conducted at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza in March 2004, indicated
that 14% of mall patrons came by bus and 6% walked. A more recent survey, conducted in
August 2008, indicated that an average of 23% of mall patrons arrived by bus and 11% walked,
with even higher rates during the weekday afternoon peak period. The results of these surveys
are shown in Appendix G.


Existing public transit ridership in the vicinity of the Project Site is much higher than what is
inherently reflected in the ITE trip generation rates, which are generally based on free-standing,
suburban sites. The Project Site is in close proximity to at least 11 existing bus lines, which
explains the high transit ridership found in the two patron surveys. As noted in Chapter 3, two
rail lines are proposed in the vicinity of the Project Site, one with a station adjacent to the
Project Site. It is expected that transit ridership will increase further when the capacity and
convenience of the rail lines are added to the area. However, despite this high level of transit
and walk-in traffic, for the purposes of a conservative analysis, transit and walk credits of only
10% were taken on the primary land uses on the site (retail, restaurant, and entertainment).
Higher credits of 20% for office and 25% for the residential land uses were taken to reflect the
greater likelihood that commuting trips would occur by non-automotive modes (particularly
transit).


A pass-by credit of 10% on retail trips and 40% on grocery store trips was applied. Internal
capture credits of 5% were taken at all non-residential uses with the exception of the grocery
store use, where a 15% internal capture credit was applied.


Table 10 provides a summary of the trip generation rates and estimates for the existing and
proposed land uses accounting for the reductions described above. As shown in the table, it is
estimated that the Project Site at full buildout would generate a total of 40,974 daily trips on a
typical weekday, including approximately 1,375 morning peak hour trips (760 inbound, 615
outbound) and 3,747 afternoon peak hour trips (1,877 inbound, 1,872 outbound). On a typical
Saturday midday peak hour, the Project Site at full buildout is expected to generate
approximately 4,472 trips (2,405 inbound, 2,067 outbound). Similarly, the existing land uses are
estimated to generate a total of 27,490 daily trips on a typical weekday, including approximately
501 morning peak hour trips (314 inbound, 187 outbound) and 2,455 afternoon peak hour trips
(1,242 inbound, 1,213 outbound), as well as approximately 3,243 Saturday midday peak hour
trips (1,797 inbound, 1,446 outbound). Therefore, the Project is expected to generate a net total


                                                                                               27

of 13,484 daily trips on a typical weekday, including approximately 874 morning peak hour trips
(446 inbound, 428 outbound) and 1,294 afternoon peak hour trips (635 inbound, 659 outbound),
and approximately 1,229 Saturday midday peak hour trips (608 inbound, 621 outbound).




PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION


Similar to the trip distribution of traffic from the Related Projects, the geographic distribution of
trips generated by the Project is dependent on the locations of residential and employment
centers from which the patrons of the Project would be drawn, characteristics of the street system
serving the Project Site, and the level of accessibility of the routes to and from the Project Site.
The general distribution pattern for this study was developed in conjunction with LADOT and by
reviewing the results of the survey conducted at the Project Site in year 2004, which identified
origin zip codes and census tracts of mall patrons. The origin information was analyzed and
translated into the trip distribution pattern illustrated in Figure 16, with adjustments made to reflect
the larger Project, which may draw patrons from further away than the existing shopping center.




PROJECT TRIP ASSIGNMENT


The Project trip generation estimates summarized in Table 10 and the distribution patterns
illustrated in Figure 16 were used to assign the Project-generated traffic through the 55
analyzed intersections. Figures 17 and 18 illustrate the Project-only peak hour traffic volumes
at the analyzed intersections during typical weekday and Saturday peak hours, respectively.

                              Existing and Future with Project Conditions


This chapter describes the results of the analysis of intersection operating conditions with Project
construction as measured against existing (year 2011) and future (year 2020) conditions without
the Project. Within this Chapter, both the Existing with Project conditions and the Future with
Project conditions, before mitigation, are presented for the 55 study intersections. Also, significant
impact assessments were conducted for both scenarios according to the criteria set forth by
LADOT.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Project-only volumes shown in Figures 17 and 18 were added to the Existing traffic
volumes shown in Figures 4 and 5.          The resulting Existing with Project (year 2011) traffic
volumes are illustrated in Figures 19 and 20 for weekday and Saturday peak hours, respectively.
They represent Existing with Project conditions, i.e., existing conditions assuming development of
the Project.   Peak hour traffic volumes for the analyzed intersections in tabular form are
provided in Appendix D.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Existing with Project conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways, and intersection
configurations with development of the Project in year 2011.


The study intersections were analyzed using the CMA methodology described in Chapter 2. The
Existing with Project intersection operating conditions for typical weekday morning and afternoon
peak hours and Saturday midday peak hour are shown in Table 11. Figures 21, 22, and 23
graphically illustrate the Existing with Project LOS at the analyzed intersections during the
weekday morning, weekday afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.


                                                                                                   30

Intersection lane configurations and detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendices B and
F, respectively.


As shown in Table 11, under Existing with Project conditions, 42, 41, and 53 of the 55 analyzed
intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or better during the weekday morning, weekday
afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.          The remaining intersections are
expected to operate at LOS E or F.




SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA FOR INTERSECTIONS


As set forth in Chapter 1, LADOT has established threshold criteria used to determine the
significant traffic impact of a proposed project on the signalized study intersections. LADOT
standards indicate that a project is considered to have a significant traffic impact on a signalized
intersection if the increase in the V/C ratio attributable to the project exceeds a specific standard
depending on the final intersection LOS. It should be noted that the significant impact criteria
for signalized intersections identified in the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide is consistent with the
LADOT criteria.


LADOT has developed a sliding scale in which the minimum allowable increase in the V/C ratio
decreases as the V/C ratio increases:


                   Intersection Conditions      Significant Impact Threshold for
                      with Project Traffic          Project-related Increase
                    LOS             V/C                    in V/C Ratio
                      C        0.701 - 0.800       Equal to or greater than 0.04
                      D        0.801 - 0.900       Equal to or greater than 0.02
                     E, F         > 0.900          Equal to or greater than 0.01
              Source: City of Los Angeles.


Using these criteria, for example, a project would not have a significant impact at an intersection
if it is operating at LOS C after the addition of project traffic and the incremental change in the
V/C ratio is less than 0.040. If the intersection, however, is operating at a LOS F after the
addition of project traffic and the incremental change in the V/C ratio is 0.010 or greater, the
project would be considered to have a significant impact. A project is not considered to have a
significant impact if the intersection is projected to operate at LOS A or B after the addition of



                                                                                                  31
                                                                                                   89
project traffic, regardless of the volume of traffic added to the intersection or the incremental
change in the V/C ratio.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION IMPACTS, BEFORE MITIGATION


Table 11 provides a summary of the significant impact analysis under Existing with Project
conditions, before mitigation, conducted for the 55 study intersections based on the criteria
established by LADOT at different levels of service during the analyzed peak hours. Figure 24
graphically illustrates the significantly impacted intersections under the Future with Project
scenario, before mitigation.    As shown in Figure 24, at least one intersection beyond all
significantly impacted intersections was analyzed in the direction of Project traffic to ensure that
all significantly impacted intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed.


During the weekday morning peak hour in year 2011, the Project is expected to result in a
significant impact at five intersections. During the weekday afternoon peak hour in year 2011,
the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at 11 intersections. During the Saturday
midday peak hour in year 2011, the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at eight
intersections.   Intersections impacted during one peak hour are not necessarily the same
intersections as those impacted during another peak hour.          A total of 14 of the 55 study
intersections are expected to be impacted during one or more peak hours. The Project is not
expected to result in a significant traffic impact at the remaining 41 study intersections during
any peak hour.


It should be noted that according to LADOTâs significant impact criteria, the higher the Existing
with Project V/C ratio, the lower the amount of project traffic that can be added before causing a
significant impact. Under Existing with Project conditions, 19 of the 55 study intersections are
projected to operate a V/C equal to or greater than 0.900 during at least one of the analyzed
peak hours (LOS E or F), where a very minor increase in traffic (fewer than 17 vehicles in the
same direction per hour in some cases) would trigger a significant impact per LADOT impact
thresholds.

FUTURE WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Project-only volumes shown in Figures 17 and 18 were added to the Future without Project
traffic volumes shown in Figures 11 and 12. The resulting Future with Project traffic volumes are
illustrated in Figures 25 and 26 for weekday and Saturday peak hours, respectively. These traffic
volumes are the sum of the existing traffic volumes, ambient growth, Related Project traffic, and
Project-only traffic. They represent Future with Project conditions, i.e., future conditions after the
development of the Project in the year 2020.         Peak hour traffic volumes for the analyzed
intersections are provided in tabular form in Appendix D.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS, BEFORE MITIGATION


The Future with Project conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways, and
intersection configurations that would exist in the year 2020 following development of the
Project.


The study intersections were analyzed using the CMA methodology described in Chapter 2. The
Future with Project intersection operating conditions for typical weekday morning and afternoon
peak hours and Saturday midday peak hour are shown in Table 12. Figures 27, 28, and 29
graphically illustrate the Future with Project LOS at the analyzed intersections during the weekday
morning, weekday afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively. Intersection lane
configurations and detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendices B and F, respectively.


As shown in Table 12, under the Future with Project conditions, 38, 37, and 45 of the 55
analyzed intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or better during the weekday morning,
weekday afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.                     The remaining
intersections are expected to operate at LOS E or F.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION IMPACTS, BEFORE MITIGATION


Table 12 provides a summary of the significant impact analysis, before mitigation, conducted for
the 55 study intersections based on the criteria established by LADOT at different levels of


                                                                                                   33

service during the analyzed peak hours.         Figure 30 graphically illustrates the significantly
impacted intersections under the Future with Project scenario, before mitigation. As shown in
Figure 30, at least one intersection beyond all significantly impacted intersections was analyzed
in the direction of Project traffic to ensure that all significantly impacted intersections, prior to
any mitigation, were analyzed.


During the weekday morning peak hour in year 2020, the Project is expected to result in a
significant impact at eight intersections. During the weekday afternoon peak hour in year 2020,
the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at 14 intersections. During the Saturday
midday peak hour in year 2020, the Project is expected to result in a significant impact at 13
intersections.   Intersections impacted during one peak hour are not necessarily the same
intersections as those impacted during another peak hour.          A total of 17 of the 55 study
intersections are expected to be impacted during one or more peak hours. The Project is not
expected to result in a significant traffic impact at the remaining 38 study intersections during
any peak hour.


It should be noted that according to LADOTâs significant impact criteria, the higher the Future
with Project V/C ratio, the lower the amount of project traffic that can be added before causing a
significant impact.   Under Future with Project conditions, 23 of the study intersections are
projected to operate a V/C equal to or greater than 0.900 during at least one of the analyzed
peak hours (LOS E or F), where a very minor increase in traffic (fewer than 17 vehicles in the
same direction per hour in some cases) would trigger a significant impact per LADOT impact
thresholds.

              Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Program


The analysis presented in this Chapter has been prepared as part of the TIA for the Project. The
various guidelines, methods, and assumptions mandated by LADOT, wherever applicable, have
been used in the preparation of this analysis.


The mitigation program for the Project includes the following major components:

   1. Transit and mobility system improvements, including the provision of additional public
      service along specific corridors and contribution to the Los Angeles Bicycle Plan.

   2. Transportation Systems Management (TSM) improvements, including signal controller
      upgrades and installation of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at key intersections
      within the Study Area in the City of Los Angeles.

Additionally, specific intersection improvements, including physical mitigations and signal system
and phasing enhancements, were considered at a number of study intersections. Ultimately,
these improvements were not selected for implementation due to secondary impacts they would
cause, such as loss of on-street parking or narrow lanes.       A discussion of the considered
improvements is included in this Chapter.




TRANSIT AND MOBILITY SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS


The key components of the Projectâs transit and mobility improvement program include:

     1. Regional Bus Transit System Improvements
     2. Construction of a Mobility Hub
     3. Contribution to the Los Angeles Bicycle Plan
     4. Transportation Demand Management Program

These improvements are aimed at enhancing and improving service of the overall mobility system
serving the Study Area.



                                                                                               36

Regional Bus Transit System Improvements


An extensive analysis was conducted to determine potential transit improvements to the existing
transportation system serving the Project Site. A number of transit lines currently serve the Study
Area, as discussed in Chapter 2. As shown in Table 6, all of the existing routes operated by
Metro are currently operating below their maximum capacity during the weekday peak hours.
However, by the year 2020, when the Project is complete, it is anticipated that transit ridership
could increase due to two factors:

   1. Ambient traffic growth and traffic growth due to new developments in the area, including
      the Project, may cause traffic conditions to deteriorate and make public transit a more
      attractive option.

   2. Additional transit options, such as the Metro Crenshaw and Expo Lines, will increase the
      connectivity and efficacy of transit within and around the Study Area, also making public
      transit a more attractive option.

In order to bolster transit capacity and LOS in the Study Area, the Project proposes to purchase a
new bus for Metro Route 210, which travels north and south on Crenshaw Boulevard. The Project
will also pay for total operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for the new bus during weekday
peak hours (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) and during Saturday midday peak
hours (12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.) for the first three years. To ensure continued operations, the
Project will pay for the unsubsidized portion of these costs for an additional seven years. Farebox
revenues and state/federal transit subsidies shall be credited against O&M costs for Years 1
through 10. These buses have a seated capacity of 40 people and a standing capacity of 50
people and will supplement the bus service along this corridor. The bus may be deployed to
another route or location within the Study Area if determined by Metro to serve a greater need.


This increased transit capacity along the impacted intersections on the identified corridor would
offer the ability to reduce the number of automobiles in the corridor served by the additional bus.
As many as 40 peak hour person-trips in the peak direction of travel are expected to be served by
the proposed transit system improvement package.        An estimate of the potential automobile
reduction at each impacted location is made by comparing the additional bus seating capacity
added to the system at that location to the typical auto occupancy of 1.20 persons per auto in the
Study Area. Thus, the addition of one bus per hour has the ability to reduce the hourly automobile
travel in the corridor by 33 automobiles per direction (40 seats per direction per bus/1.2 persons



                                                                                                  37

per auto = 33 auto trips).      To account for the additional transit capacity along Crenshaw
Boulevard, a credit of 33 trips has been applied during each of the analyzed peak hours. Figure
31 indicates the intersections that receive these credits.




Construction of a Mobility Hub


As the City of Los Angeles expands its public transit infrastructure with new bus routes and rail
lines, it continues to look for further ways to enhance the connectivity of the various service
options, as well as ways to serve the âlast mileâ between the nearest transit stop and a patronâs
origin or destination. A recent initiative that is gaining traction is to install âmobility hubsâ near
transit stations around the City.     These hubs would provide secure bicycle storage, shuttle
services, and vehicle sharing programs, including conventional and electric bicycles, scooters,
and cars.


In light of this initiative, the Project proposes to allocate space for, and fund, a mobility hub on the
Project Site. This hub will help to make the Project Site a central hub for transit throughout the
Project vicinity, especially with the proposed Metro Crenshaw Line expected to open in the year
2018.




Bicycle Plan Contribution


In March 2011, the City of Los Angeles adopted the 2010 Bicycle Plan, A Component of the City
of Los Angeles Transportation Element (Los Angeles Department of City Planning), which
describes a Citywide bikeway system comprised of on-street bicycle lanes, designated bicycle
routes, and Bicycle Friendly Streets. The 2010 Bicycle Plan proposes designated bicycle facilities
throughout the Study Area. Nearest to the Project Site, bicycle lanes are proposed on Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Crenshaw Boulevard, Exposition Boulevard, and 54th Street. Bicycle
Friendly Streets are proposed on Coliseum Street, Buckingham Road, 39th Street, Santa Rosalia
Drive, Degnan Street, Stocker Street, 43rd Street, 48th Street, and Leimert Boulevard.


The Project would contribute $100,000 toward the implementation of bikeway improvements
within the Study Area under the 2010 Bicycle Plan. This would contribute to areawide bicycle


                                                                                                     38
                                                                                                     133
mobility, which in turn improves access to public transit by helping serve the âlast mileâ for transit
riders.




Transportation Demand Management Program


Per LAMC Section 12.26-J, the Project is required to provide and maintain a transportation
demand management (TDM) program for the office portion of the Project and for employees of
the remaining Project land uses. Consistent with LAMC requirements for a development in
excess of 100,000 square feet of gross floor area, the TDM program will provide a bulletin board
or kiosk with transportation-related information, designated carpool and vanpool parking spaces,
and safe pedestrian and bicycle circulation from the surrounding streets to the Project buildings
and bicycle parking facilities. No reduction in Project trip generation was assumed as a result of
this TDM program for the purposes of maintaining a conservative traffic impact analysis.




TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS


As part of the mitigation program, the Project would implement several TSM improvements
recommended by LADOT within the Study Area, including analyzed intersections and others.
LADOT has determined that the TSM improvements described below would improve traffic
operations and increase intersection capacity by approximately 1% along corridors.               The
Applicant shall install or contribute towards the design and installation of signal controller
upgrades, CCTV cameras, and system loops.




Signal Controller Upgrades


Many study intersections within the City of Los Angeles jurisdiction currently operate with the
Type 170 signal controller. Newer controllers (Type 2070) provide for enhanced and real-time
operation of traffic signal timing.    Type 2070 controllers allow LADOT to provide instant
adjustments to the signalâs timing parameters to respond to real-time traffic demands. The
Project would upgrade the signal controllers at the following locations:




                                                                                                   39
                                                                                                   134

Closed Circuit Television Cameras


An integral part of the real-time operation of the traffic signal timings is the strategic placement
of CCTV cameras at key intersections. This provides LADOT with the ability to monitor traffic
operations and respond instantly to incidents that delay vehicles and transit service.         The
Project would fund the installation of CCTV cameras at the following locations:




                                                                                                 40

System Loops


A system loop is an advance detector loop that is embedded in the street pavement. These
loops identify volume and occupancy and are used to determine the appropriate signal timing
parameters. These loops give LADOT the ability to extend the green time for an approach so
that car platoons generally do not have to stop. They are located at an appropriate distance
from the intersection so that a vehicle just upstream of the loop can comfortably decelerate to a
stop when the yellow signal is displayed. The Project would fund the installation of system
loops at the following locations:


     6.    Marlton Avenue & Project Driveway
     7.    Marlton Avenue & Santa Rosalia Drive (four loops)

Improved Corridor Operations


The City of Los Angeles has determined that the TSM improvements described above would
increase intersection capacity. Therefore, as approved by LADOT, a 1% (a 0.01 improvement
in V/C ratio) increase in intersection capacity has been accounted for along the following
corridors:

   ï·   La Brea Avenue, between 23rd Street and Rodeo Road
   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard, between Washington Boulevard and Hyde Park Boulevard
   ï·   Arlington Avenue, between Jefferson Boulevard and Slauson Avenue
   ï·   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, between Rodeo Road and Normandie Avenue
   ï·   Marlton Avenue, between Santa Rosalia Drive and 39th Street
   ï·   Stocker Street, between Don Felipe Drive and Crenshaw Boulevard
   ï·   Leimert Boulevard, between Crenshaw Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard




SPECIFIC INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS


A number of intersection improvements designed to alleviate the significant impacts of the
Project were considered. These consisted of physical improvements (such as minor widening)
and signal phasing enhancements. Ultimately, the secondary impacts of these improvements
were deemed to outweigh the potential benefits of their installation and, therefore, they are not
recommended as mitigation measures for the Project.

   ï·   Intersection #1 â Crenshaw Boulevard & 39th Street â This improvement would consist of
       restriping the eastbound and westbound approaches of 39th Street. The eastbound
       approach would be modified to provide two left-turn-only lanes and one shared
       through/right lane. The westbound approach would be modified to provide one left-turn-
       only lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. This improvement was rejected
       because the through lanes on 39th Street across the intersection could not be sufficiently
       aligned to allow safe operations. Further, implementation of this improvement would
       require the removal of two on-street parking spaces on the south side of 39th Street west of
       Crenshaw Boulevard.

   ï·   Intersection #4 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Stocker Street â This improvement proposes
       adding a northbound through lane by removing three parking spaces from the east side of
       Crenshaw Boulevard north of Stocker Street. The parking space is peak-period restricted
       (no parking allowed from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on weekdays) and its removal would result in
       approximately 290 feet of red curb on Crenshaw Boulevard north of Stocker Street in


                                                                                                42
                                                                                                137
    which northbound traffic could merge back into one of the remaining two through lanes
    during times other than the weekday morning peak hour. South of the intersection, there
    is red curb for approximately 380 feet leading up to the intersection, allowing the curb lane
    to act as a full-capacity shared through/right lane. Also, the improvement would include
    converting the existing eastbound right-turn lane into a shared through/right lane. The
    improvement was rejected because the third northbound through lane would only exist for
    a short distance, resulting in an unsafe condition where traffic would be forced to merge
    back into two lanes immediately north of the intersection and possibly leading to additional
    congestion. Further, implementation of this improvement would require the removal of
    three on-street parking spaces on Crenshaw Boulevard north of Stocker Street.

ï·   Intersection #17 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard â This improvement
    proposes widening the eastbound approach to provide an exclusive right-turn-only lane.
    The resulting eastbound approach would consist of one left-turn-only lane, two through
    lanes, and one right-turn-only lane. The improvement was rejected because the additional
    five feet needed for a turn lane would require reducing the sidewalk width from 12 feet to
    seven feet.

ï·   Intersection #24 â Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard â This
    improvement proposes to extend the existing directional peak period parking restrictions
    along both Arlington Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard such that they apply
    equally to both weekday morning and afternoon peak hours. Currently, there are weekday
    morning peak period parking restrictions in the northbound and eastbound directions and
    weekday afternoon peak period parking restrictions in the southbound and westbound
    directions. The proposed improvement would place weekday morning and afternoon peak
    period parking restrictions in all four directions surrounding the intersection, resulting in an
    extra lane of capacity during both weekday peak periods. This improvement does not
    affect the operating conditions during the Saturday midday peak period. However, it was
    rejected because it would require the loss of on-street parking on Arlington Avenue and
    Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in all directions during additional peak periods, which
    adversely affects the local residents and businesses.

ï·   Intersection #29 â La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road â This improvement proposes to
    restripe the existing westbound right-turn lane to a shared through/right lane. The
    westbound departure lane provides a red curb for approximately 200 feet, allowing drivers
    to merge back into the two existing westbound lanes. This improvement was rejected
    because the short merge would result in an unsafe condition for westbound traffic and
    could lead to additional congestion.

ï·   Intersection #47 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Adams Boulevard â This improvement
    proposes to restripe Adams Boulevard to provide a right-turn-only lane along the
    eastbound approach. Currently, there is 90 feet of red curb on the existing approach,
    providing enough space to handle the eastbound right-turn traffic. The improvement was
    rejected because the eastbound right-turn traffic volume is too low to warrant the
    installation of the turn lane.

EXISTING WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS, AFTER MITIGATION


The Existing with Project with Mitigation conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways,
and intersection configurations in year 2011 with development of the Project and the
transportation improvement and mitigation program identified above.


The study intersections were analyzed using the CMA methodology described in Chapter 2. The
Existing with Project with Mitigation intersection operating conditions for typical weekday and
Saturday peak hours are shown in Table 13. Figures 32, 33, and 34 graphically illustrate the
Existing with Project with Mitigation LOS at the analyzed intersections during the analyzed peak
periods. Detailed LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix F.


As shown in Table 13, under the Existing with Project with Mitigation conditions, 42, 44, and 53
of the 55 analyzed intersections are projected to operate at LOS D or better during the weekday
morning, weekday afternoon, and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively. The remaining
intersections are expected to operate at LOS E or F.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION IMPACTS, AFTER MITIGATION


Table 13 provides a summary of the significant impact analysis, after mitigation, conducted for
the 55 study intersections based on the criteria established by LADOT at different levels of
service.


Table 13 shows that the Projectâs transportation mitigation program would mitigate three of the
five weekday morning peak hour impacted intersections, two of the 11 weekday afternoon peak
hour impacted intersections, and three of the eight Saturday midday peak hour impacted
intersections under Existing with Project conditions.       Overall, five of the 14 impacted
intersections would be mitigated below the level of significance by the proposed mitigation
program.


Residual significant impacts after the implementation of the mitigation program remain at nine
study intersections, including:




                                                                                               44

Table 14 provides a summary of the significant impact analysis, after mitigation, conducted for
the 55 study intersections based on the criteria established by LADOT at different levels of
service.


Table 14 shows that the Projectâs transportation mitigation program would mitigate five of the
eight weekday morning peak hour impacted intersections, five of the 14 weekday afternoon
peak hour impacted intersections, and six of the 13 Saturday midday peak hour impacted
intersections under Future with Project conditions.       Overall, seven of the 17 impacted
intersections would be mitigated by the proposed mitigation program.


Residual significant impacts after the implementation of the mitigation program remain at 10
study intersections, including:

summarize the 10 residual significant intersection impacts of the Project under Future with Project
with Mitigation (year 2020) conditions. In total, 11 distinct study intersections are expected to be
impacted by the Project, after mitigation, under existing or future conditions.


At the 11 remaining significantly impacted intersections, no further physical improvements are
feasible, as noted below.


   ï·   Intersection #1 â Crenshaw Boulevard & 39th Street â The geometry of the intersection to
       accommodate the frontage roads on Crenshaw Boulevard north and south of 39th Street
       preclude any feasible physical mitigation that would be required to fully mitigate the Project
       impact at this location. The physical improvement proposed at this location was rejected
       because of the inability to safely align the eastbound through lane and the loss of parking
       on 39th Street.

   ï·   Intersection #3 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard â Existing
       buildings on all four corners of the intersection preclude any feasible physical mitigation
       that would be required to fully mitigate the Project impact at this location. Additionally, this
       intersection is the site of a future rail station upon construction of the Metro Crenshaw Line
       by 2018, further limiting the ability to effect any physical improvements.

   ï·   Intersection #4 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Stocker Street â Existing private property on all
       four corners of the intersection preclude any feasible widening to add capacity to this
       location.

   ï·   Intersection #17 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard â Existing private property
       on all four corners of the intersection precludes any feasible widening to add capacity to
       this location.

   ï·   Intersection #24 â Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard â Existing
       buildings on all four corners of the intersection preclude any feasible physical mitigation
       that would be required to fully mitigate the Project impact at this location.

   ï·   Intersection #28 â La Brea Avenue & Jefferson Boulevard â Existing buildings on all four
       corners of the intersection as well as the Metro Expo line immediately to the south
       preclude any feasible physical mitigation that would be required to fully mitigate the
       Project impact at this location.

   ï·   Intersection #29 â La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road â Existing buildings on all four
       corners of the intersection preclude any feasible physical mitigation that would be
       required to fully mitigate the Project impact at this location.

   ï·   Intersection #31 â La Brea Avenue / Overhill Drive & Stocker Street â There is open land
       on several sides of this intersection. However, the necessary scale of any potential
       improvement to this intersection, especially considering the topography of the terrain, is
       beyond the scope of this Project.




                                                                                                    47

ï·   Intersection #47 â Crenshaw Boulevard & Adams Boulevard â Existing private property
    on all four corners of the intersection precludes any feasible widening to add capacity to
    this location.

                                Congestion Management Program Analysis


This chapter presents an analysis of the regional transportation facilities in the vicinity of the
Project, in accordance with the TIA procedures outlined for the CMP. This Chapter summarizes
the analysis procedure and, where necessary, the results of the analysis for arterial
intersections, freeway segments, and transit lines.




TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS GUIDELINES


As referenced above, the CMP requires three different types of analysis, depending on whether
the traffic levels meet certain criteria.


    1. Intersection Level of Service Analysis â The CMP requires that a TIA be performed for all
       designated CMP arterial monitoring intersections where a project would add 50 or more
       trips during either the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours.

    2. Freeway Segment Analysis â The CMP requires that a TIA be performed at all designated
       mainline freeway monitoring locations where a project would add 150 or more trips (in
       either direction) during the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours.

    3. Transit Impact Review â The CMP requires a transit impact review analyzing the capacity
       of the transit system and the impact of new passengers from the proposed Project.

In the case where the trip thresholds referenced above are not met, no further analysis is
required. Additionally, the CMP does not require any analysis of Saturday conditions.




Significant Traffic Impact Criteria


According to the CMP guidelines, a significant project-related impact would be identified if the
CMP intersection or freeway facility is projected to operate at LOS F (V/C > 1.00) and if project
traffic causes an incremental change in the V/C ratio of 0.02 or greater.          The proposed



                                                                                               50
                                                                                               163
development would not be considered to have a regionally significant impact, regardless of the
increase in V/C ratio, if the analyzed facility is projected to operate at LOS E or better after the
addition of project traffic.




ARTERIAL MONITORING STATION ANALYSIS


The CMP has three designated arterial monitoring stations within the Study Area and two more
within one mile of the Study Area, as shown in Figure 40.           Two of the five locations are
intersections that were selected for the traffic analysis presented in preceding chapters. The
five locations selected for evaluation, shown with their CMP station identification (ID) numbers,
include:

    24.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue (south of Study Area)
    25.    La Brea Avenue & Manchester Avenue (south of Study Area)
    46.    La Cienega Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard (Study Intersection #33)
    47.    La Cienega Boulevard & Centinela Avenue
    95.    La Cienega Boulevard & Stocker Street (Study Intersection #35)


As discussed above, a traffic impact analysis is only required at locations where peak hour
Project-only traffic is expected to exceed 50 trips in all directions combined. Figure 17 shows
the Project-only traffic during the weekday peak hours for the study intersections, including the
two study intersections that are also designated arterial monitoring stations. As it shows, the
Project traffic on these arterial monitoring stations is not expected to exceed:

    46.    La Cienega Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard â 16 trips in the morning peak hour and
           26 trips in the afternoon peak hour (based on Project-only volumes at intersection
           #33)

    95.    La Cienega Boulevard & Stocker Street â 26 trips in the morning peak hour and 39
           trips in the afternoon peak hour (based on Project-only volumes at intersection #35)

At the remaining three arterial monitoring stations, Project traffic from study intersections on the
periphery of the Study Area was conservatively assumed to continue without dissipation in the
same direction through adjacent intersections. In other words, trips travelling out of the Study
Area are assumed to remain on the same course indefinitely, passing through any arterial



                                                                                                 51
                                                                                                 164
monitoring station in their path. Therefore, Project traffic at the remaining three designated
arterial monitoring stations is estimated to be:

   24.    La Brea Avenue & Manchester Avenue â eight trips in the morning peak hour and 13
          trips in the afternoon peak hour (based on Project-only traffic volumes at intersection
          #42)

   25.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue â 35 trips in the morning peak hour and
          51 trips in the afternoon peak hour (based on Project-only traffic volumes at
          intersection #50)

   47.    La Cienega Boulevard & Centinela Avenue â 13 trips in the morning peak hour and
          19 trips in the afternoon peak hour (based on Project-only traffic volumes at
          intersections #35, #36, #37, and #42)

Of the five arterial monitoring stations, only one (#25, Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester
Avenue) is expected to fall above the 50-trip analysis threshold during one of the peak hours.
Therefore, an arterial impact analysis is warranted for that intersection alone.      No further
analysis is required at the other four intersections.




Arterial Impact Analysis


Additional analysis for a potential traffic impact is required CMP monitoring station #25, the
intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue, which is conservatively estimated to
experience a traffic increase of 51 trips during the afternoon peak hour. Half of these trips are
expected to travel north through the intersection on their way to the Project Site and the other
are expected to travel south away from the Project Site.


New traffic counts were conducted at this intersection during the morning and afternoon peak
periods on April 26, 2011. The traffic impact analysis was conducted for Existing Conditions
(Year 2011), Future without Project Conditions (Year 2020), and Future with Project Conditions
(Year 2020). The results of the analysis are detailed below.




                                                                                              52
                                                                                              165
Existing Conditions (Year 2011)


The peak hour traffic count data was analyzed using the CMA methodology, as in the Project
analysis in preceding chapters. Table 15 shows that the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard &
Manchester Avenue currently operates at LOS C during the morning peak hour and LOS D
during the afternoon peak hour.




Future without Project Conditions (Year 2020)


The Future without Project traffic volumes were projected using the methodology described in
Chapter 3. The existing traffic volumes were increased by an ambient growth factor (0.5% per
year for nine years from 2011 to 2020, or 4.59% total) and traffic from nearby related projects
was added in. Similar to Project traffic, all related project traffic at the periphery of the study
area was assumed to continue without dissipation in the same direction through adjacent
intersections.


The resulting Future without Project traffic volumes were analyzed using the CMA methodology.
Table 15 shows that the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue would
operate at LOS C during the morning peak hour and LOS E during the afternoon peak hour in
Year 2020 with the expected ambient and related project traffic growth.




Future with Project Conditions (Year 2020)


As discussed above, the Project is conservatively estimated to increase traffic by 25 trips in the
northbound direction and 26 trips in the southbound direction at the CMP monitoring station
during the afternoon peak hour. Similarly, it is expected to increase traffic by 18 trips in the
northbound direction and 17 trips in the southbound direction during the morning peak hour.
The addition of these Project traffic volumes to the Future without Project traffic volumes
projected above results in the Future with Project traffic volumes.


The Future with Project traffic volumes were analyzed using the CMA methodology. Table 15
shows that the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Manchester Avenue would operate at


                                                                                                53
                                                                                                166
LOS C during the morning peak hour and LOS E during the afternoon peak hour in Year 2020
with traffic from all sources factored in. Because the intersection does not operate at LOS F, it
does not meet the minimum threshold for identification of a significant impact. Therefore, the
Project impact at the intersection is considered less than significant under CMP criteria and no
further arterial monitoring station analysis is needed.




FREEWAY SEGMENT ANALYSIS


The CMP has one designated freeway mainline monitoring station within the Study Area and
two more within one mile of the Study Area, as shown in Figure 40.           The three locations
selected for evaluation, shown with their CMP station ID numbers, include:


     1011. I-10 east of Overland Avenue
     1012. I-10 east of La Brea Avenue
     1013. I-10 at Budlong Avenue


As discussed above, a traffic impact analysis is only required at locations where peak hour
Project-only traffic is expected to exceed 150 trips in both directions combined. The following
levels of traffic are expected at each of the monitoring stations:


     1011. I-10 east of Overland Avenue â 18 trips in the morning peak hour and 26 trips in
           the afternoon peak hour
     1012. I-10 east of La Brea Avenue â 18 trips in the morning peak hour and 26 trips in the
           afternoon peak hour
     1013. I-10 at Budlong Avenue â 18 trips in the morning peak hour and 26 trips in the
           afternoon peak hour


None of the three freeway mainline monitoring stations are expected to experience Project trips
above the 150-trip threshold during either peak hour. Therefore, no further freeway mainline
analysis is warranted, and the Project impact at the three monitoring stations is considered less
than significant under CMP criteria.




                                                                                              54
                                                                                              167
Additional freeway operation analyses (both freeway mainline and ramp intersections) were
conducted at Caltransâ request for long range planning and informational purposes using
Caltransâ guidelines and are provided in Appendix H.




REGIONAL TRANSIT SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS


This section provides a description of the transit analysis performed in accordance with the CMP
TIA guidelines. The CMP transit analysis requirements include the following components:

   ï·   Evidence that affected transit operators received the Notice of Preparation (NOP)
   ï·   Existing transit service in the study area
   ï·   Project trip generation estimates
   ï·   Project transit trip estimates
   ï·   Project components to encourage transit use
   ï·   Analysis and mitigation




Existing Transit Service


Two transit providers, Metro and LADOT DASH, provide service in the vicinity of the Project Site.
Table 5 and Figure 9 summarize the transit lines within the Study Area. Currently, the Metro bus
system provides 27 bus lines in the form of both rapid and local service in the area. The LADOT
DASH system provides three local bus lines in the area.




Project Trip Generation Estimates


As shown in Table 16, the Project would be expected to generate a total of 16,381 daily
automobile trips on a typical weekday, including approximately 1,079 morning peak hour trips and
1,575 afternoon peak hour trips, if all Project patrons traveled to the Project Site by automobile.
The total number of vehicular trips to and from the Site is reduced by people expected to use
alternative transportation, including transit, carpooling, and walking. The transit/high occupancy
vehicle (HOV)/walk credits accounted for a total reduction of 2,897 daily automobile trips on a


                                                                                                55
                                                                                                168
typical weekday, including approximately 205 morning peak hour trips and 281 afternoon peak
hour trips.




Project Transit Trip Estimates


Based on the guidelines outlined in Section D.8.4 of the CMP, the amount of vehicular trip
reduction due to alternative transportation modes was converted into an increase in transit trips
to and from the Project. In accordance with the methodology, an average vehicular occupancy
(AVO) factor of 1.40 in order to estimate the number of person trips to and from the Project.


Some of the peak hour vehicular trips from the Project Site reduced by the transit/HOV/walk
adjustment would shift to commute options other than transit, e.g. telecommute, carpool,
vanpool, bicycle, and/or walking. However, the transit trip estimates summarized in Table 16
are based on a conservative estimate that all of the vehicular trips reduced by the
transit/HOV/walk adjustment would translate into transit trips and none to other non-motorist
modes such as walking and bicycling. As shown in the table, assuming an AVO of 1.40, the
Project Site is expected to generate approximately 4,056 daily transit trips, including 287
morning peak hour trips and 393 afternoon peak hour trips.




Project Components to Encourage Transit Use


The Project proposes several methods to promote alternative modes of travel to and from the
Project Site, including carpooling, transit usage, bicycling, and walking. As discussed in Chapter
5, the Project will increase transit capacity by adding a peak hour bus to Metro Route 210
travelling on Crenshaw Boulevard adjacent to the Project Site. The Project will also construct a
mobility hub on the Project Site. The mobility hub would serve to enhance mobility connectivity,
including providing bicycle storage, shuttle services, vehicle sharing programs, and having
proximity to transit service.


A detailed description of the above improvements can be found in Chapter 5.




                                                                                                56
                                                                                                169
Regional Transit System Impacts


Based on the anticipated number of transit trips generated by the Project, an analysis of the
potential Project impact on the transit system was conducted. There are a total of eight Metro bus
lines and two LADOT Dash lines operating along the periphery of the Project. Based on the
existing average load factors in the morning and afternoon peak hours in the Project vicinity
(developed from existing ridership data for the Metro lines serving the Project Site periphery),
shown in Table 6, it was determined that there is residual capacity on the existing transit system
on all major transit lines serving the Project Site.


Load factors were calculated based on the peak hourly load on the bus and the average hourly
capacity on that route (calculated from average headways). Assuming that the maximum load on
the transit lines increases at the ambient growth rate of 0.5% per year (a total of 4.59% through
the year 2020), the residual capacity on the transit system in 2020 without the Project is expected
to be 419 in the morning peak hour and 547 in the afternoon peak hour.


The Project is proposing to provide an additional bus with a seated capacity of 40 and a standing
capacity of 50 to supplement the current service on Metro Route 210. Accounting for the transit
trips generated by the Project and the additional buses proposed as part of the Projectâs
improvement program, the residual capacity on the transit system in 2020 with the Project and its
improvements is expected to be 182 in the morning peak hour and 204 in the afternoon peak
hour. Therefore, the anticipated transit demand from the Project on a systemwide basis would be
more than satisfied by the capacity surplus and the Project is not expected to significantly impact
the regional transit system. Tables 17 and 18 summarize the assumptions, calculations, and
results from the analysis.

This chapter presents an analysis of the future parking requirements and demands of the
proposed Project. The existing development provides a total of 3,235 off-street parking spaces
between surface parking lots and parking decks.


The proposed Project would provide a total of 6,550 parking spaces, including 4,550 for the
commercial land uses on the Project Site and 2,000 spaces for the residential land uses. The
North Area of the Project Site would contain 1,274 commercial parking spaces and 1,829
residential parking spaces for a total of 3,103 spaces. This parking would be provided primarily
underground and through a new parking structure in the northwest corner of the Site. The
South Area of the Project Site would provide 3,276 commercial parking spaces and 171
residential parking spaces for a total of 3,447 spaces. The existing parking deck in the South
Area would be retained as an open-air structure and a new structure would be built at the south
end of the Site.   Another existing parking structure would be modified to connect to the
proposed retail anchor at the southeast corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard & Marlton
Avenue.


The parking analysis was conducted in two ways. First, parking requirements were analyzed for
the individual components of the project according to the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC)
(City of Los Angeles, revised February 4, 2010). In this analysis, the land uses on site were
treated as stand-alone uses. Second, in conformance with the LAMC, a shared-parking analysis
was conducted to determine whether the Project would provide sufficient parking to accommodate
projected peak parking demands. In mixed-use developments, the Planning Department can
approve a shared parking analysis as an alternate to the LAMC individual land use parking
requirements.


According to the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide, a project would normally be considered to have
a significant parking impact if the number of spaces required to accommodate project activities
exceeds the number of parking spaces provided.


                                                                                             59
                                                                                             176
CODE REQUIREMENTS

LAMC parking requirements for the Project were calculated by applying the appropriate parking
ratios from the LAMC, Section 12.21A.4. The Advisory Agency Policy 2000-1 also requires the
provision of a 0.25 guest parking space per condominium dwelling unit.


The following parking rates are indicated:

   ï·   Commercial office, restaurant, retail, and supermarket at two spaces per 1,000 sf.
   ï·   Cinema at one space per five seats.
   ï·   Fitness center and dance studio at 10 spaces per 1,000 sf.
   ï·   Bowling alley at two spaces per 1,000 sf of lane area and 10 spaces per 1,000 sf of
       remaining floor area.
   ï·   Hotels must provide one space for each of the first 30 rooms provided, one-half of a space
       per room for the next 30 hotel rooms and one-third of a space per room (or one space for
       every three hotel rooms) for each of the remaining rooms.
   ï·   Hotel banquet space and meeting space at one space for every 35 sf.
   ï·   Hotel restaurant space at two spaces per 1,000 sf.
   ï·   Apartments must provide 1.5 spaces per single-bedroom unit and two spaces per two-
       bedroom unit.
   ï·   Condominiums, per the Advisory Agency Policy, must provide two spaces per unit as well
       as guest spaces at a rate of 0.25 spaces per unit.


Additionally, according to Section 12.24-Y of the LAMC, the parking requirement for certain
transit-proximate land uses may be reduced by 10%. These land uses, specified in LAMC
Section 12.21-A,4(c), include the office component of the Project as well as the fitness center
and dance studio.


As shown in Table 19, the Project would require a total of 1,968 parking spaces for residential
uses and 4,615 spaces for commercial uses using LAMC parking requirements. The proposed
parking supply of 2,000 residential spaces is sufficient for the residential component of the
Project, but the 4,550 commercial spaces provided would not meet the LAMC parking
requirement.    However, the LAMC allows the on-site parking supply requirement to be
determined through the application of shared parking/demand principles, as described below.




                                                                                              60
                                                                                              177
SHARED PARKING DEMAND ANALYSIS


While the LAMC specifies the minimum parking supply for a development consisting of the sum of
the individual parking supply for each land use within that development, such a calculation does
not always represent the true parking demand for that development.            Within a mixed-use
development, in which various land uses generate parking demands at varying levels throughout
a day, month, and year, a parking stall can effectively serve the peak parking demand of multiple
land uses. In order to account for the sharing of the parking supply between the various Project
land uses, a shared parking analysis was prepared which analyzes the cumulative peak parking
demand taking into account the various time-of-day and month-of-year demand variations of each
land use. The parking analysis was performed using the model in Shared Parking, 2nd Edition
(Urban Land Institute [ULI] and the International Council of Shopping Centers [ICSC], 2005).


ULI/ICSC describes shared parking as follows:


   Shared parking is defined as parking space that can be used to serve two or more individual
   land uses without conflict or encroachment. The opportunity to implement shared parking is
   the result of two conditions:

   ï·   Variations in the peak accumulation of parked vehicles as the result of different activity
       patterns of adjacent or nearby land uses (by hour, by day, by season).

   ï·   Relationships among land use activities that result in peopleâs attraction to two or more
       land uses on a single auto trip to a given area or development.

Most zoning codes, including those in Los Angeles, provide peak parking ratios for individual
land uses.   While this appropriately recognizes that separate land uses generate different
parking demands on an individual basis, it does not reflect the fact that the combined peak
parking demand, when a mixture of land uses shares the same parking supply, can be
substantially less than the sum of the individual demands. For example, retail uses peak in the
early to mid-afternoon while restaurant uses peak in the lunchtime and/or evening hours
(depending on the type of restaurant).


Each land use within the Project was considered separately in order to identify the peak parking
demands of each project component. Because residential spaces are reserved for residents
and their guests, and are not shared with commercial patrons, the residential parking demand
and supply was not included in this analysis.


                                                                                                    61
                                                                                                178
Table 20 summarizes the input assumptions of the shared parking analysis.               For each
commercial land use in the Project, the tables show the base parking demand ratio for a
weekday and a Saturday, the driving ratio (i.e., the automobile mode split for each land use,
modeled after the rates used for Project trip generation in Table 10), the percentage of demand
projected to be captured internally within the project (also modeled after the rates in Table 10),
and the peak hour and peak month adjustment ratios. Because of the significant difference
between parking demand in the peak month and a typical month, both analyses have been
presented below.




Peak Parking Demand in a Typical Month


The month of June was selected for analysis of a typical month as being representative of the
non-peak months of the year. Table 21 shows that a typical weekday in June would have a
relatively constant parking demand throughout the day and into the evening with a peak of
4,367 spaces at 1:00 p.m. A typical weekend would have peak parking demand in the late
afternoon with a demand of 4,476 spaces at 5:00 p.m.




Peak Parking Demand in the Peak Month


The peak month of the year, in terms of parking demand, is December. Table 22 shows that the
peak weekday parking demand would be 5,551 spaces, including 4,077 customer parking
spaces and 1,474 employee spaces, at 1:00 p.m. The peak weekend parking demand would be
5,677 spaces at 3:00 p.m., including 4,495 customer parking spaces and 1,182 employee
spaces.




Comparison of Commercial Parking Demand to Supply


The peak parking demand on a weekend in June of 4,476 spaces would be easily
accommodated by the proposed 4,550 spaces on the Project Site.            Therefore, in a typical
month, parking demand would be satisfied.




                                                                                               62
                                                                                               179
The peak parking demand in the peak month of the year, December, is higher than the
proposed supply. On a weekday in December, the peak parking demand is estimated to be
5,551 spaces, 1,001 spaces greater than the parking supply. On a Saturday in December, the
peak parking demand is estimated to be 5,677 spaces, 1,127 spaces greater than the parking
supply.


Charts 1 and 2 show the estimated peak parking demands for each month of the year for
weekdays and weekends, respectively. As they indicate, the proposed parking supply of 4,550
spaces is adequate to satisfy the peak parking demand every month of the year except during
the holiday shopping season in November and December. In December, there would be a
maximum shortfall of 1,127 spaces at 2:00 p.m. on a Saturday. In order to counter this shortfall,
the Project will institute an operational parking program during the holiday shopping season in
late November and all of December to ensure that the level of demand can be adequately
accommodated. The program will include one or more of the following measures as necessary:


   ï·      Identification of one or more areas of on-site parking where tandem parking will be
          operated on a temporary basis with attendant parking for employees.
   ï·      Operation of valet parking for customers with tandem parking in certain areas.
   ï·      Use of off-site parking for employees with a shuttle van to and from the Project Site.
   ï·      A program to encourage employees to rideshare and/or use transit during the peak
          month of December.




Conclusion


As demonstrated above, parking supply is sufficient to meet demand 11 months out of the year.
The Project will accommodate the projected December shortfall by implementing one or more
demand reduction/supply maximization measures as described above. As such, there will be
no significant parking impacts caused by the Project.

                                                    Site Access and Circulation


This chapter summarizes the site access and internal circulation for the Project. The access
impacts analysis relates to the provision of access to and from the Project Site, which may
include safety, operational, or capacity impacts, and was performed in accordance with the
guidelines outlined in the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide.




PROPOSED SITE ACCESS


The proposed site access plan for the Project is illustrated in Figure 41, showing 12 Project
driveways. The changes to the existing vehicular access plan are minor. They include the
addition of two unsignalized, right-in/right-out driveways in the North Area (#1 on Crenshaw
Boulevard and #12 on Marlton Avenue) and the proposed signalization of the main South Area
driveway (#6) on Crenshaw Boulevard. Internal vehicular circulation would also remain largely
unchanged.


As a mixed-use development with residential, hotel, office, retail, and entertainment uses, the
Project would include an improved pedestrian environment. The pedestrian circulation plan
would include increased points of entry from the exterior property boundaries, widened
pedestrian walkways, street furniture and bus shelters along the Project periphery, and striped
and signalized pedestrian crosswalks linking the land uses. The pedestrian bridge over Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard would be retained so that the North Area and South Area would
continue to operate as a single site with people able to park on one block and walk to uses on
the other block.




                                                                                            65
                                                                                            187
ACCESS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA â OPERATIONAL


According to the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide, a project would have a significant access impact
if the intersection(s) nearest the primary site access is/are projected to operate at LOS E or F
during the morning or afternoon peak hour, under Future with Project conditions.




ACCESS IMPACT ANALYSIS â OPERATIONAL


The access impact analysis was performed for existing and all future scenarios.           Table 23
summarizes the LOS analysis from Chapters 4 and 5 for the study intersections nearest to the 12
Project driveways for each traffic scenario. All of these intersections are signalized locations and
assumed to operate under the LADOT ATSAC system in the Existing Conditions scenario and
under the ATCS system for all future conditions.




Future with Project Conditions, Before Mitigation


As shown in Table 23, the Project is expected to have a significant access impact at three of the
access locations under the Future with Project conditions, before mitigation:

      4.       North Area driveway from Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
      5.       South Area driveway from Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
      6.       South Area main driveway from Crenshaw Boulevard




Future with Project with Mitigation Conditions


Under the Future with Project with Mitigations conditions, the Project would still have significant
access impacts at the same three access locations.           Due to physical constraints at the
intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, no improvements could
be identified that would fully mitigate the Project impact at these access locations to less than
significant.




                                                                                                 66
                                                                                                 188
Bicycle Lanes


No dedicated bicycle lanes currently exist on the streets providing Project access. However, the
recently adopted 2010 Los Angeles Bicycle Plan, A Component of the City of Los Angeles
Transportation Element (Los Angeles Department of City Planning, adopted March 1, 2011)
shows future bicycle lanes on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard
adjacent to the Project Site. Currently, funding only exists for the stretch of bicycle lane along
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Crenshaw Boulevard to the west. When these bicycle
lanes are implemented, they will cross six of the 12 Project driveways. A potential operational
impact could exist upon their implementation, depending on the level of bicycle ridership they
attract.




ACCESS IMPACT ANALYSIS â SAFETY


The Projectâs driveways would be designed according to the LAMC to ensure adequate sight
distance and bicycle and pedestrian safety. No hazard issues are expected to result due to the
access locations.

                                               Neighborhood Intrusion Impacts


This section presents an analysis of the intrusion impacts to neighborhoods in the vicinity of the
Project, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide.




SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLD FOR NEIGHBORHOOD INTRUSION IMPACTS


The L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide offers recommended thresholds for neighborhood intrusion
impacts based on the addition of project traffic on the future traffic conditions of neighborhood
streets, as follows:

        A proposed project would normally have a significant neighborhood intrusion impact if
        project traffic increases the average daily traffic (ADT) volume on a local residential
        street in percentages equal to or greater than the following:

                ï·   ADT increase from Project > 16% if final ADT < 1,000
                ï·   ADT increase from Project > 12% if final ADT > 1,000 and < 2,000
                ï·   ADT increase from Project > 10% if final ADT > 2,000 and < 3,000
                ï·   ADT increase from Project > 8% if final ADT > 3,000

        Final ADT is defined as total projected daily traffic volume including Project and existing
        traffic under Existing with Project conditions (year 2011), and Project, existing, ambient
        growth, and related project growth under Future with Project conditions (year 2038).

Based on LADOTâs recommendation, a significance threshold of 120 project trips was adopted
for the impact analysis. Hence, for any neighborhood in which traffic could be increased by 120
trips per day or more on any local residential streets, a potentially significant impact by the
Project, prior to mitigation, is identified.




                                                                                                69
                                                                                                192
METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINATION OF IMPACT


Based on LADOT policy, three conditions must be met to create the conditions under which
there could be a significant impact on local streets in a neighborhood:

   1. There must be sufficient Project traffic projected to be added to an arterial corridor such
      that the volume that may shift to an alternative route could exceed the minimum
      significance threshold of 120 or more daily trips. The majority of vehicles on an arterial
      corridor tend to remain on that corridor even under congested conditions, as only a small
      portion of motorists are inclined to seek alternative routes. Therefore, corridors to which
      the Project may add 1,200 or more daily trips were examined, assuming that at most
      only 10% of these trips may shift to alternative routes on average across a 24-hour
      period (the proportion that may shift could be higher than 10% during congested peak
      periods of the day but much less than 10% or almost none during uncongested non-
      peak periods of the day).

   2. There must be sufficient congestion on arterial corridors selected above such that
      motorists traveling along the corridor may desire to divert to a parallel route through a
      residential neighborhood. Unless congestion is severe, travel along arterial streets is
      generally faster than through neighborhoods, since arterial streets typically provide
      greater capacities, higher travel speeds, less driveway access, fewer stop signs, etc.
      For the purposes of this analysis, intersections operating at LOS E or F along an arterial
      corridor were considered to represent congested conditions sufficient to cause motorists
      to seek alternative routes.

   3. There must be available local neighborhood street(s) providing a parallel route of travel.

If one or more of these factors is absent, significant neighborhood traffic impacts would not be
anticipated.



NEIGHBORHOOD INTRUSION IMPACT ANALYSIS


The neighborhood intrusion impact analysis was conducted for the Future with Project (year
2020) conditions. The three factors used in projecting a neighborhood impact analysis are
assessed below.




                                                                                               70
                                                                                              193
Arterial Corridors Meeting Project Trip Threshold


As discussed in Chapter 4 and shown in Table 10, the Project is expected to generate a net
total of 13,484 daily trips on a typical weekday.      Figure 16 shows Project trip distribution
percentages through the Study Area. Based on LADOT policy, any arterial corridor projected to
increase by 1,200 or more daily trips from Project traffic would meet the Project traffic condition
for assessing neighborhood intrusion impacts. This would represent 9.0% of the total daily
traffic to and from the Project Site. The arterial corridors that have 1,200 or more trips added to
them by the Project include:


   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard between Adams Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
   ï·   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Crenshaw Boulevard and Normandie Avenue
   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Slauson Avenue
   ï·   Rodeo Road between La Brea Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
   ï·   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Rodeo Road & Crenshaw Boulevard




Intersections Operating at LOS E or F Along Affected Corridors


Several intersections along the affected corridors are projected to operate at LOS E or F under
Future with Project conditions. They include:


       3.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
       4.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Stocker Street
       16.   Crenshaw Boulevard & Slauson Avenue
       17.   Crenshaw Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard
       24.   Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
       26.   Buckingham Road & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
       29.   La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road
       47.   Crenshaw Boulevard & Adams Boulevard
       53.   Western Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard




                                                                                                71
                                                                                                194
Based on the locations of these intersections and LADOT policy, all five corridors identified
above should be examined for alternative routes through residential neighborhoods.




Availability of Parallel Local Streets


LADOT policy specifies the identification of viable cut-through routes on local residential streets
in order for a neighborhood intrusion impact to be found. The affected corridors identified above
were examined for the availability of parallel local streets that could be used as a cut-through
route to avoid arterial congestion:


Parallel to Crenshaw Boulevard between Adams Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard
   ï·   There are several potential alternative routes west of Crenshaw Boulevard, including
       Victoria Avenue, Somerset Drive, Wellington Road, Virginia Road, and Buckingham
       Road. All run parallel to Crenshaw Boulevard, though Buckingham Road is the only one
       that provides a route to cross Exposition Boulevard and the Expo Light Rail tracks. Most
       intersections along these roads are stop-controlled.

   ï·   There are also several potential alternative routes east of Crenshaw Boulevard,
       including Bronson Avenue, Norton Avenue, Grayburn Avenue / 12th Avenue, Edgehill
       Drive, and Degnan Boulevard / 11th Avenue. All run parallel to Crenshaw Boulevard,
       though Degnan Boulevard / 11th Avenue is the only one that provides a route to cross
       Exposition Boulevard and the Expo Light Rail tracks. Most intersections along these
       roads are stop-controlled.

Parallel to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Crenshaw Boulevard and Normandie
Avenue
   ï·   There are several potential alternative routes south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
       including 41st Street, 41st Drive, 41st Place, 42nd Street, and 42nd Place. All run parallel
       to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, but all are also discontinuous throughout the
       segment. Most intersections along these roads are stop-controlled.

Parallel to Crenshaw Boulevard between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Slauson Avenue
   ï·   There are several potential alternative routes east of Crenshaw Boulevard, including 11th
       Avenue, 10th Avenue, 9th Avenue, and 8th Avenue. All run parallel to Crenshaw
       Boulevard, though only 11th Avenue and 8th Avenue are continuous between Vernon
       Avenue & Slauson Avenue, and 11th Avenue has speed humps along many segments to
       discourage cut-through traffic. Most intersections along these roads are stop-controlled.




                                                                                                72
                                                                                                195
   ï·   There are also several potential alternative routes west of Crenshaw Boulevard,
       including Victoria Avenue, Brynhurst Avenue, Chesley Avenue, and West Boulevard. All
       run parallel to Crenshaw Boulevard, though only Victoria Avenue stretches all the way
       north to Stocker Street and the Project Site. Most intersections along these roads are
       stop-controlled.

Parallel to Rodeo Road between La Brea Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
   ï·   There are no local residential streets parallel to Rodeo Road that could provide a
       convenient cut-through route to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

Parallel to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Rodeo Road and Crenshaw Boulevard
   ï·   Santa Rosalia Drive is a potential alternative route to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
       It parallels Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the south between Coliseum Street and
       Stocker Street. It is signalized at most intersections.



Summary of Potential Neighborhood Intrusion Impacts


Figure 42 shows the arterial corridors with 1,200 or more Project trips, the intersections
projected to operate at LOS E or F under Future with Project conditions, and the potential cut-
through routes identified above. On the basis of the analysis above, six neighborhoods were
identified that may be subject to significant neighborhood intrusion impacts by the Project.
These neighborhoods, illustrated in Figure 43, are the areas bounded by the following:


   1. Adams Boulevard to the north, Crenshaw Boulevard to the east, Martin Luther King Jr.
      Boulevard to the south, and Buckingham Street to the west.

   2. Adams Boulevard to the north, Degnan Boulevard / 11th Avenue to the east, Martin
      Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the south, and Crenshaw Boulevard to the west.

   3. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north, Normandie Avenue to the east, 42nd Place
      to the south, and Leimert Boulevard to the west.

   4. Vernon Avenue to the north, 8th Avenue to the east, Slauson Avenue to the south, and
      Crenshaw Boulevard to the west.

   5. Stocker Street to the north, Crenshaw Boulevard to the east, Slauson Avenue to the
      south, and West Boulevard to the west.

   6. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north, Marlton Avenue to the east, Santa Rosalia
      Drive to the south, and Coliseum Street to the west.




                                                                                             73
                                                                                             196
NEIGHBORHOOD INTRUSION MITIGATION MEASURES


The neighborhood intrusion analysis presented above identified those neighborhoods that might
be susceptible to neighborhood intrusion impacts (cut-through traffic) as a result of the Project.
However, it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty whether such
neighborhood intrusion traffic will occur at a level sufficient to result in a significant adverse
impact in any of the identified neighborhoods as the changes in traffic patterns are based on a
number of factors, including individual driver perception of the likely reduction in travel time on
alternative route (neighborhood streets). Nor is it possible to predict in which neighborhoods or
on which streets within each neighborhood any such potentially significant neighborhood
intrusion traffic impacts might occur. In addition, because of the fact that such assessments
cannot be made at this time, it also cannot be determined whether any feasible mitigation
measures could be implemented that would lessen or eliminate such potentially significant
impacts or determine what neighborhood measures the local community would prefer over the
potentially significant neighborhood traffic intrusions.


LADOT has developed a process over many years to assess the nature of the impacts, and a
range of traffic measures designed to address potentially significant impacts.        The LADOT
process is an iterative one through which the impacted neighborhood is included in the process
to help assess which traffic calming options are preferred by the community at issue, to balance
the relative desirability of the options, and ultimately to let the community itself make the
decision whether to implement the traffic calming measures.         In some neighborhoods, the
potential significant impact never materializes. In locations where a significant impact does
occur, the community may decide to implement traffic calming measures that reduce the impact
to below the level of significance and, in other neighborhoods, the measures themselves are
considered to be undesirable and so the community prefers not to implement them and the
neighborhood intrusion traffic impact remains significant and unmitigated.


There is a range of traffic calming measures that can be implemented that have been shown to
reduce neighborhood intrusion traffic to a point of insignificance. Those measures can include
non-restrictive traffic control measures such as traffic circles, speed humps, roadway narrowing
(e.g., raised medians and traffic chokers), landscaping features, roadway striping changes (e.g.,
bike lanes or parking striping to reduce the perceived width of the roadway), stop signs, new
sidewalks, and new pedestrian amenities. Traffic calming measures can also include more


                                                                                                74
                                                                                                197
restrictive physical/operational improvements such as turn restrictions, cul-de-sacs, traffic
diverters, street blockers, and signal metering, but those more restrictive measures themselves
have the potential to divert traffic to another residential street. Table 24 presents a list of typical
neighborhood improvement measures.           The table also identifies the effects of each of the
proposed improvements in terms of cut-through traffic reduction, speed reduction, directional
control, noise, safety emergency response time, and the relative cost of implementation of these
measures. As shown in the table, while most of the improvements would also help in speed
reduction, noise reduction, and increased safety, these improvements may also result in an
increase in emergency response time.


The traffic calming measures listed in Table 24 have been used in various communities and
have been proven to be effective at reducing neighborhood intrusion impacts by reducing or
eliminating neighborhood intrusion traffic and/or improving the appearance of a neighborhood.
For example, turn restrictions limit the ability of vehicles to move from the main arterial to the
alternative neighborhood streets during peak hours; cul-de-sacs and street closures cut off the
ability to connect to the main corridors; and speed humps and stop signs slow the travel time on
neighborhood streets which eliminates the incentive to divert from the main corridor. However,
traffic calming measures are also sometimes considered undesirable to a neighborhood
because they may alter the neighborhoodâs character or annoy residents (e.g., having to stop at
multiple intersections, reduced lanes, etc.) Whether such measures are helpful or undesirable
overall depends on each communityâs preferences and so it is inherently subjective unless and
until a specific neighborhood intrusion impact is observed and studied, measures are developed
to address the traffic intrusion, and the community is consulted and polled to determine the
communityâs wishes. If the community does not support the mitigation actions, then they are
deemed by the LADOT policy to be infeasible and will not be imposed upon a community that
does not want them.


Due to the uncertainties surrounding the potential significantly impacted areas, including the
uncertainty over whether any such impact will even occur, in an abundance of caution, for
purposes of this analysis, the potential neighborhood intrusion impact is considered significant,
and a Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan process by which the intrusion impact can be
identified and mitigated if in the future any of the identified potentially impacted communities
determines that it wants the measures to be implemented has been incorporated into the
mitigation for neighborhood intrusion impacts. However, because it is possible that a significant


                                                                                                    75
                                                                                                    198
impact may occur and that one or more neighborhoods might determine that it does not want to
implement the mitigation actions, it is not possible to determine now whether such a potential
neighborhood intrusion impact would be fully mitigated were it to occur.          Accordingly, it is
conservatively concluded that with the identified mitigation, the potentially significant impact will
not be fully mitigated. As a further step, this impact is treated as significant even after the
implementation of all feasible mitigation measures.


Accordingly, the following mitigation measure is recommended to provide mechanisms for the
development of Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan(s) in the potentially impacted
neighborhoods, should they be requested by residents in the community:


       The Applicant or its successors fund and coordinate implementation of LADOTâs
       Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan process for the Project, in an amount to be
       determined by the Applicant and LADOT. The Applicant will conduct traffic counts on
       various local residential streets prior to construction of the Project to serve as a baseline
       for assessing Project-related significant neighborhood intrusion impacts. Eligible
       communities shall include the residential neighborhoods within the boundaries listed
       below:

           1. Adams Boulevard to the north, Crenshaw Boulevard to the east, Martin Luther
              King Jr. Boulevard to the south, and Buckingham Street to the west.

           2. Adams Boulevard to the north, Degnan Boulevard / 11th Avenue to the east,

                                                  Construction Impact Analysis


This chapter summarizes the construction impact analysis for the Project. The construction
impact analysis relates to the temporary impacts that may result from the construction activities
of the Project, which may include safety, operational, or capacity impacts, and was performed in
accordance with the guidelines outlined in the L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide.




TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS


The L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide identifies four types of in-street construction impacts and 16
factors to be used for determining the significance of a projectâs impacts. Each of the four types
of construction impacts refers to a particular population that could be inconvenienced by
construction activities. The four types of impacts and related populations are:

     1.    Temporary traffic impacts â potential impacts on vehicular travelers on roadways
     2.    Temporary loss of access â potential impacts on visitors entering and leaving sites
     3.    Temporary loss of bus stops or rerouting of bus lines â potential impacts on bus
           travelers
     4.    Temporary loss of on-street parking â potential impacts on parkers


The factors identify the components that determine whether an impact might occur, or the extent
to which it might occur. Each of the factors presents a consideration that would contribute to
either (1) a potential inconvenience in the performance of oneâs daily activities (i.e., an impact
on traffic operations) and/or (2) a concern to public safety and have been considered in
determining the extent to which an inconvenience or threat to safety would occur. These two
significance thresholds address potential inconvenience and safety, respectively.




                                                                                                 78
                                                                                                 203
Traffic impacts from construction activities would be expected to occur as a result of the
following types of activities:


    ï·     Increases in truck traffic associated with export or import of fill materials and delivery of
          construction materials
    ï·     Increases in automobile traffic associated with construction workers traveling to and from
          the site
    ï·     Reductions in existing street capacity from temporary lane closures necessary for the
          construction of roadway improvements, utility relocation, and drainage facilities
    ï·     Blocking existing vehicle or pedestrian access to other parcels fronting streets


The impact of construction truck traffic (including haul trucks) would be a lessening of the
capacities of access streets and haul routes due to slower movements and larger turning radii of
trucks.




PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE


The construction schedule of the Project assumes the Project would be divided into five zones
that would be constructed over a five-year period from year 2011 to year 2016. During this
period, the existing retail space that would remain as part of the Project would maintain normal
operations. Table 25 summarizes the construction schedule.




TEMPORARY TRAFFIC IMPACTS


Construction traffic is expected to be generated by two primary sources: construction worker
trips to and from the site at the beginning and end of the workday and haul truck traffic to and
from the site throughout the day. The respective traffic expected to be generated by each
source is described below.




                                                                                                    79
                                                                                                    204
Construction Worker Traffic


Construction worker traffic would depend on not only the level of effort during various
construction phases, but also on the mode and time of travel of the workers. The construction
schedule for the Project assumed an average 10-hour workday (6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) six days
a week. Construction workers would be on-site before 6:00 a.m. and leave the site after 4:00
p.m. Therefore, the workers would be on-site before the morning commute peak period and
would leave the site during the afternoon commute peak period. The construction program
assumes that 10% of the workers would use public transit to commute to the site, 50% would
drive alone, and 40% would carpool (two workers per vehicle).          However, this analysis
conservatively assumes that all construction workers would drive alone to and from the
construction site.


Table 25 summarizes the projected number of workers for each stage of construction in each of
the five construction zones on the Project Site. There are four phases of construction in each
construction zone: demolition, grading, construction, and finishing. Each phase will require a
different number of construction workers.    In accounting for the maximum number of daily
workers at any given time, the worst case would be where each construction zone was
simultaneously involved in its most intensive phase. Table 25 shows that, at most, there would
be 167 construction workers on the site on a given day. Note that the schedule does not allow
for this worst-case level of construction workers, but it is being assumed for the purposes of a
conservative analysis.


Each worker generates two daily trips â one to, and one from, the construction site. Therefore,
it is expected that construction workers alone would generate a maximum of 334 daily trips, with
167 outbound trips during the afternoon peak hour.




Haul Truck Traffic


Table 25 shows the various levels of haul activity for each construction zone during each phase
of construction. Similar to the discussion above regarding construction worker levels, the most
possible daily haul trips would occur if the most intense haul-generating phase of each




                                                                                             80
                                                                                             205
construction zone occurred simultaneously.         Table 25 indicates that in the worst case,
construction activity could yield 225 haul trips to and from the site per day.


As with construction workers, each haul truck generates two daily trips â one to, and one from,
the construction site. Large trucks like those used to haul construction material affect traffic
congestion more than that of the average passenger vehicle. Therefore, the number of truck
trips is multiplied by a passenger car equivalency (PCE) rate of 2.0.      Transportation Research
Circular No. 212 defines PCE for a vehicle as the number of through moving passenger cars to
which it is equivalent based on the vehicleâs headway and delay- creating effects. Table 8 of
the Transportation Research Circular No. 212 suggests a PCE of 2.0 for trucks. As a result, the
225 daily haul trucks are expected to result in 450 daily truck trips which is equivalent to 900
daily passenger car trips to and from the site.


As discussed above, construction activity is expected to take place over a 10-hour workday from
6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Assuming a uniform distribution of haul trucks throughout the workday,
the construction site would generate a maximum of 90 PCE trips (45 inbound, 45 outbound)
during each hour of the workday.




Construction Traffic Impacts


When combined, construction worker trips and haul trips are expected to result in a total of 90
morning peak hour trips (45 inbound, 45 outbound) and 257 afternoon peak hour trips (45
inbound, 212 outbound).


During construction, approximately 92,041 sf of existing shopping center space is expected to
be closed and demolished. This will reduce the trip-generating activity on the Project Site
commensurate with the amount of demolition. Table 26 shows that the Project Site will reduce
trip generation by 4,951 daily trips, including 113 during the morning peak hour (69 inbound, 44
outbound) and 436 during the afternoon peak hour (213 inbound, 223 outbound), the number of
shopping center trips that would be removed from the street system with the removal of 92,041
sf of shopping center space.




                                                                                               81
                                                                                               206
Since the construction worker and haul truck trips expected to be generated during the peak
stages of construction are lower than the trips generated by the existing uses that will be
removed, traffic from construction workers is not expected to result in a significant impact on the
street system.


During construction, an adequate number of parking spaces for construction workers would be
available at all times either on the Project Site or in the Project vicinity, or the Project would
provide a shuttle to an off-site parking location for the construction workers. Therefore, Project
construction would result in a less than significant impact with regard to the availability of
parking spaces.




Proposed Haul Truck Routes


The locations to be used for importing and exporting construction fill materials have not been
determined at this time. However, it is generally anticipated that the nearest available landfills
will be used, and the most direct routes from the Project Site to the local freeways will be used
to travel to and from those landfills. As such, it is expected that most haul traffic will travel
directly to the nearby freeways using the following corridors:


   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard to access I-10 to the north
   ï·   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to access I-110 to the east
   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard to access I-105 to the south
   ï·   Stocker Street and La Cienega Boulevard to access I-405 to the southwest


As discussed above, the level of truck activity during peak hours will be offset by the removal of
existing trips through the demolition of some of the existing land uses on the Site. Therefore,
the level of haul truck activity would result in a less-than significant impact on these corridors.




                                                                                                      82
                                                                                                      207
POTENTIAL PHYSICAL IMPACTS FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY


Potential impacts associated with physical construction of the Project, e.g., partial lane or
sidewalk closures or loss of bus stops or parking, would be limited to those roads immediately
adjacent to the Project Site:

   ï·   Crenshaw Boulevard
   ï·   Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
   ï·   Stocker Street
   ï·   Santa Rosalia Drive
   ï·   Marlton Avenue
   ï·   39th Street


Lane closures on the roadways would require a temporary reduction in lane capacity (one lane
in one direction) and would cause delays for vehicles traveling in that direction.      Sidewalk
closures would require temporary rerouting of pedestrian traffic. Where possible, sidewalks and
bus stops would remain open under protective construction shielding. On-street parking is
currently only allowed on portions of Santa Rosalia Drive and Marlton Avenue, and qualitative
observations indicate that this parking is seldom used.       Otherwise, the physical effects of
construction would be limited.


Due to the temporary nature of any such closures, impacts to the streets and sidewalk facilities
are considered adverse, not significant.




CONSTRUCTION MITIGATION MEASURES


Despite the fact that construction of the proposed Project is not expected to result in any
significant traffic impacts, various mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize the
effects of construction activity. The Project Applicant will prepare detailed construction traffic
management plans, including lane closure information, detour plans, haul routes, and staging
plans satisfactory to the affected jurisdictions. The construction traffic management plans shall
be based on the nature and timing of the specific construction and other projects in the vicinity
of the Project Site, and shall include the following elements as appropriate:


                                                                                               83
                                                                                               208
1.   Provisions to configure construction parking to minimize traffic interference
2.   Provisions for temporary traffic control if necessary to improve traffic flow on public
     roadways (e.g., flag person)
3.   Scheduling construction activities to reduce the effect on traffic flow on arterial
     streets
4.   Rerouting construction trucks to reduce travel on congested streets
5.   Provision of dedicated turn lanes for movement of construction trucks and equipment
     on- and off-site in accordance with the construction traffic management plans
     approved by LADOT
6.   Not allowing construction-related vehicles to park on streets in predominantly
     residentially-zoned areas
7.   Provision of safety precautions for pedestrians and bicyclists through such measures
     as alternate routing and protection barriers
8.   Obtaining the required permits for truck haul routes from the City of Los Angeles
     prior to the issuance of any permit for the Project

This chapter presents a qualitative analysis of four potential Project Alternatives identified as
part of the EIR. A brief description of each Alternative is included, along with its land uses, trip
generation estimates, parking requirements, and a qualitative impact analysis. The assumptions
for these Alternatives are similar to those outlined for the Project in Chapter 4. All analysis is
based on future (year 2020) conditions similar to the Future with Project conditions described in
Chapter 5 and the Future with Project with mitigation conditions described in Chapter 6. Table
27 contains a summary of the land uses contained in each Alternative and Table 28 contains a
comparison of the trip generation for each Alternative to the Project trip generation.


In each Alternative, the qualitative traffic impact analysis compares the traffic conditions with the
construction of the Alternative to the Future without Project traffic conditions described in
Chapter 3. The four Alternatives are:


   ï·     Alternative 2 â Existing Zoning
   ï·     Alternative 3 â 25% Reduction
   ï·     Alternative 4 â 50% Reduction
   ï·     Alternative 5 â Alternative Land Use


Table 27 summarizes the land use program and Table 28 summarizes the trip generation
estimates for each Alternative. The impacts associated with each Alternative are presented
below.




ALTERNATIVE 2 â EXISTING ZONING


Alternative 2 presents a project designed to take advantage of existing zoning on the Project
Site. It assumes a reduction in number of residential units, hotel rooms, and commercial square
footage. As a smaller project, Alternative 2 would correspondingly have a lesser impact on


                                                                                                  86
                                                                                                  212
traffic in the Project vicinity. Table 27 shows the sizes of the various land uses as proposed in
Alternative 2.



Trip Generation


Table 29 shows the trip generation estimates for Alternative 2. As it indicates, Alternative 2
would generate approximately 11,191 net daily trips including approximately 744 trips during the
morning peak hour, 1,084 trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 1,022 trips during the
Saturday midday peak hour.


Alternative 2 would produce approximately 17% fewer total trips than the proposed Project. As
shown in Table 29, it would produce 2,293 fewer daily trips, 130 fewer trips during the morning
peak hour, 210 fewer trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 207 fewer trips during the
Saturday midday peak hour.




Traffic Impact Analysis


Based on the trip generation estimates from Table 29, Alternative 2 would have a lesser impact
on the traffic levels in the Project vicinity than the proposed Project. The incremental change in
V/C ratio at the analyzed intersections would be reduced by approximately 17% in accordance
with the reduction in trip generation. This reduction is expected to eliminate two traffic impacts
before implementation of the mitigation program described in Chapter 6 and three of the
residual Project impacts after mitigation. Therefore, under Alternative 2 it is expected that nine
residual significant traffic impacts would remain. They are:


     1.    Crenshaw Boulevard & 39th Street
     3.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     4.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Stocker Street
     17.   Crenshaw Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard
     24.   Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     29.   La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road
     31.   La Brea Avenue / Overhill Drive & Stocker Street



                                                                                               87
                                                                                               213
     53.   Western Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard




Parking Code Requirement


Alternative 2 would also have a reduced parking requirement according to the LAMC. Table 30
shows the code-based parking requirement for the Alternative. Alternative 2 would need to
provide at least 1,657 residential parking spaces and 3,850 commercial parking spaces, for a
total of 5,507 spaces. The Project would provide at least 5,507 spaces were Alternative 2
implemented at the Project Site, or a shared parking analysis would be conducted to
demonstrate the actual parking demand of the Alternative.




ALTERNATIVE 3 â 25% REDUCTION


Alternative 3 presents a 25% reduction from the proposed Project described in Chapter 4. This
assumes a smaller project, which would correspondingly have a lesser impact on traffic in the
Project vicinity. Table 27 shows the sizes of the various land uses as proposed in Alternative 3.



Trip Generation


Table 31 shows the trip generation estimates for Alternative 3. As it indicates, Alternative 3
would generate approximately 9,842 net daily trips, including approximately 669 trips during the
morning peak hour, 964 trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 899 trips during the Saturday
midday peak hour.


Alternative 3 would produce approximately 25% fewer trips than the proposed Project. As
shown in Table 31, it would produce 3,642 fewer daily trips, 205 fewer trips during the morning
peak hour, 330 fewer trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 330 fewer trips during the
Saturday midday peak hour.




                                                                                               88
                                                                                              214
Traffic Impact Analysis


Based on the trip generation estimates from Table 31, Alternative 3 would have a lesser impact
on the traffic levels in the Project vicinity than the proposed Project. The incremental change in
V/C ratio at the analyzed intersections would be reduced by approximately 25% in accordance
with the reduction in trip generation. This reduction is expected to eliminate two traffic impacts
before implementation of the mitigation program described in Chapter 6 and four of the residual
Project impacts after mitigation.   Therefore, under Alternative 3 it is expected that seven
residual significant traffic impacts would remain. They are:


     3.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     4.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Stocker Street
     17.   Crenshaw Boulevard & Jefferson Boulevard
     24.   Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     29.   La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road
     31.   La Brea Avenue / Overhill Drive & Stocker Street
     53.   Western Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard




Parking Code Requirement


Alternative 3 would also have a reduced parking requirement according to the LAMC. Table 32
shows the code-based parking requirement for the Alternative. Alternative 3 would need to
provide at least 1,476 residential parking spaces and 3,743 commercial parking spaces, for a
total of 5,219 spaces. The Project would provide at least 5,219 spaces were Alternative 3
implemented at the Project Site, or a shared parking analysis would be conducted to
demonstrate the actual parking demand of the Alternative.




ALTERNATIVE 4 â 50% REDUCTION


Alternative 4 presents a 50% reduction from the proposed Project described in Chapter 4. This
assumes a smaller project, which would correspondingly have a lesser impact on traffic in the
Project vicinity. Table 27 shows the sizes of the various land uses as proposed in Alternative 4.


                                                                                               89
                                                                                               215
Trip Generation


Table 33 shows the trip generation estimates for Alternative 4. As it indicates, Alternative 4
would generate approximately 6,142 net daily trips including approximately 458 trips during the
morning peak hour, 627 trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 568 trips during the Saturday
midday peak hour.


Alternative 4 would produce approximately 50% fewer trips than the proposed Project. As
shown in Table 33, it would produce 7,342 fewer daily trips, 416 fewer trips during the morning
peak hour, 667 fewer trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 661 fewer trips during the
Saturday midday peak hour.




Traffic Impact Analysis


Based on the trip generation estimates from Table 33, Alternative 4 would have a lesser impact
on the traffic levels in the Project vicinity than the proposed Project. The incremental change in
V/C ratio at the analyzed intersections would be reduced by approximately 50% in accordance
with the reduction in trip generation. This reduction is expected to eliminate eight traffic impacts
before implementation of the mitigation program described in Chapter 6 and seven of the
residual Project impacts after mitigation. Therefore, under Alternative 4 it is expected that four
residual significant traffic impacts would remain. They are:


     3.    Crenshaw Boulevard & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     24.   Arlington Avenue & Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
     29.   La Brea Avenue & Rodeo Road
     31.   La Brea Avenue / Overhill Drive & Stocker Street




Parking Code Requirement


Alternative 4 would also have a reduced parking requirement according to the LAMC. Table 34
shows the code-based parking requirement for the Alternative. Alternative 4 would need to
provide at least 985 residential parking spaces and 3,459 commercial parking spaces, for a total


                                                                                                 90
                                                                                                 216
of 4,444 spaces.     The Project would provide at least 4,444 spaces were Alternative 4
implemented at the Project Site, or a shared parking analysis would be conducted to
demonstrate the actual parking demand of the Alternative.




ALTERNATIVE 5 â LAND USE ALTERNATIVE


Alternative 5 presents a modified land use program from the proposed Project described in
Chapter 4 while retaining a similar overall project size. Table 27 shows the sizes of the various
land uses as proposed in Alternative 5.




Trip Generation


Table 35 shows the trip generation estimates for Alternative 5. As it indicates, Alternative 5
would generate approximately 13,878 net daily trips including approximately 959 trips during the
morning peak hour, 1,359 trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 1,248 trips during the
Saturday midday peak hour.


Alternative 5 would produce slightly more trips overall than the proposed Project. As shown in
Table 35, it would produce 394 more daily trips, 85 more trips during the morning peak hour, 65
more trips during the afternoon peak hour, and 19 more trips during the Saturday midday peak
hour.




Traffic Impact Analysis


Based on the trip generation estimates from Table 35, Alternative 5 would have a greater impact
on the traffic levels in the Project vicinity than the proposed Project. The incremental change in
V/C ratio at the analyzed intersections would be increased between 2% and 10% depending on
the peak hour in accordance with the increase in trip generation.          However, this modest
increase is not expected to produce additional traffic impacts over those produced by the
Project. Therefore, under Alternative 5 it is expected that 11 residual significant traffic impacts
would remain, just as in the Project analysis described in Chapter 6. They are:


                                                                                                91
                                                                                                217

Parking Code Requirement


Alternative 5 would also have an increased parking requirement according to the LAMC. Table
36 shows the code-based parking requirement for the Alternative. Alternative 5 would need to
provide at least 1,801 residential parking spaces and 4,206 commercial parking spaces, for a
total of 6,007 spaces. The Project would provide at least 6,007 spaces were Alternative 5
implemented at the Project Site, or a shared parking analysis would be conducted to
demonstrate the actual parking demand of the Alternative.
