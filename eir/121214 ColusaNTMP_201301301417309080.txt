This memorandum presents the data collection, analysis, and recommendations of a traffic
calming study prepared for Colusa Avenue, in the City of El Cerrito, CA. Along Colusa Avenue, the
project study area extends between Rockway Avenue in the south and Terrace Drive in the north.
The study area is shown on Figure 1.

The following pages present our findings for the neighborhood.


COLUSA AVENUE

History and Background

Between Rockway Avenue and Terrace Drive, Colusa Avenue is a 2-way local street, with a posted
speed limit of 25 mph. The roadway varies in width, ranging from 40-feet between Fairmount
Avenue and Eureka Avenue, and 30-feet between Eureka Avenue and Terrace Drive. On-street
parking is allowed on Colusa Avenue.

Colusa Avenue provides direct access to El Cerrito High School, and is classified as an Emergency
Response Route in the City's Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan.                      It is also currently
proposed as a Class III bicycle route.

The minor side streets intersecting Colusa Avenue along this segment are controlled with side-
street stops, including: Susan Avenue, Errol Drive, Eureka Avenue and Hotchkiss Avenue. Colusa
Avenue has a side-street stop at the intersection with Terrace Drive. Two high visibility crosswalks
are provided at the Eureka Avenue intersection, and one mid-block high-visibility crosswalk is
provided on Colusa Avenue, between Rockway Avenue and Susan Drive.

Moving south to north, Colusa Avenue is relatively flat from Rockway Avenue to Susan Drive.
Approaching Errol Drive, the roadway begins to slope upwards, reaching the crest at Eureka
Avenue. Horizontal curves are also present on this roadway section ­ one near Susan Drive, and
one near Errol Drive.

From Eureka Avenue to the north, the slope along Colusa Avenue begins to steepen, particularly
just north of Eureka Avenue, and just north of Hotchkiss Avenue. The steep roadway slope at
these locations is also combined with two large horizontal curves. The northern-most intersection
at Terrace Drive is at the very crest of the hill for Colusa Avenue.

Sidewalks, as well as on-street parking, are provided on both sides of Colusa Avenue, although
the sidewalk is often overtaken by parked vehicles.

In 2010, the City of El Cerrito adopted the Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan (NTMP), which
identifies a process through which a street may be evaluated for traffic control devices. If a street
or segment qualifies, various measures are presented to assist with traffic control related
concerns. For Colusa Avenue, the study segment meets the NTMP criteria based on the current
vehicle speeds exceeding the posted speed of 25 mph by 5 mph (based on 2012 data) and the
daily traffic volumes exceeding 1,000 vehicles per day. Current vehicle speeds taken on Colusa
Avenue, (south of Hotchkiss) show an 85th percentile speed of 30 mph; the current ADT along this
same segment of Colusa Avenue averages 2,200 vehicles per day.


UNDERSTANDING OF TRAFFIC CONCERNS

In response to recent concerns and a petition from the neighborhood, the City has been studying
the Colusa Avenue corridor, identifying current issues and presenting potential Tier 1 and Tier 2
measures, consistent with the NTMP.         Tier 1 measures include enforcement, education and
outreach, as well as engineering measures limited to striping, signage, and pavement markings.
Tier 2 measures are more physical elements, including speed humps, traffic circles, raised
intersections, roadway closures, and enhanced crosswalk systems. Tier 1 measures are often
recommended as a first step, and as more enforcement or adherence is needed, Tier 2 measures
are implemented.

The following concerns were raised by neighbors in a petition filed in 2011:

             ·   Speeding, especially near Eureka Avenue
             ·   Sideswipe vehicle collisions

             ·      Heavy traffic volumes during the peak commute periods
             ·      Limited sight distance at minor intersecting roadways
             ·      On-street parked vehicles blocking sidewalk and pedestrian path
             ·      Unsafe environment for multi-modal users due to the above concerns

The City held a neighborhood community meeting in January 2012 to collect additional resident
feedback. The following concerns were raised by residents during this meeting:

             ·      Poor Visibility (ranked highest on the northern section of Colusa Avenue between
                    Eureka Avenue and Terrace Avenue)
             ·      Sideswipe (ranked highest on the northern section)
             ·      Speeding (entire segment of Colusa Avenue)
             ·      Sidewalk constraints (mostly recognized along northern portion)
             ·      Sight distance (northern section)
             ·      Traffic volumes (highest on southern section

The main focus of this study is to present solutions that alleviate these concerns, including
"calming" traffic, and improving the walkability of the corridor, providing a safer experience for
pedestrians and residents.

Collision History

Fehr & Peers collected SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System) data to use in this
analysis. From a review of available data between 2007 and 2010, 11 collisions were reported
along Colusa Avenue, with the majority reported in 2009. The majority of the collisions reported
were sideswipe collisions, followed by 2 broadside collisions, one head-on collision, and one
collision with a hit object. The following collisions were reported by year.

    ·   2 collisions in 2007 (both sideswipe)
    ·   3 collisions in 2008 (2 sideswipe, 1 broadside)
    ·   5 collisions in 2009 (1 head-on, and 4 sideswipe)
    ·   2 collisions in 2010 (1 broadside, and 1 hit object)

No particular trend was reported at one location ­ the collisions were spread out along the entire
study corridor. The sideswipe collisions mostly occurred on Colusa Avenue near Susan Drive, and
north of Hotchkiss Avenue, and a few on Eureka Avenue approaching Colusa Avenue

Fehr & Peers collected turning movement counts and 48-hour tube counts on Tuesday, April 24,
2012, when school was in session. Turning movement counts were conducted at the Colusa
Avenue / Eureka Avenue intersection, between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM, to capture hours with the
highest number of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists.    48-hour tube counts were collected on
Colusa Avenue, between Stockton Avenue and Terrace Drive. Recent tube counts were also
conducted on Colusa Avenue, between Eureka Avenue and Terrace Drive, on Wednesday
November 14, 2012.

This traffic count data aided in the analysis of certain traffic control devices, including speed
tables and speed lumps, and all-way stop signs. Per the criteria outlined in the NTMP, speed
humps are not recommended on roadways with volumes greater than 4,000 average daily trips
(ADT); traffic volumes on Colusa Avenue are less than half of this criterion, however Colusa
Avenue is also an emergency response route, so speed tables or speed lumps should be
considered instead of speed humps. Volumes collected in 2012 just north of Eureka Avenue
identified 2,201 ADT on Colusa Avenue. Volume data collected in 2012 just south of Eureka
Avenue identified 2,860 ADT on Colusa Avenue.

All-Way Stop Sign Warrants

The Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue intersection was evaluated for all-way stop control. The NTMP
proposes criteria for assessing if all-way stop control should be installed at an intersection on a
residential street, based on volumes (a combination of vehicle and pedestrian), collision history,
and visibility.   Exceptions are granted to these criteria based on the overall neighborhood
circulation and special considerations. A street must meet either the volume, collision history or
visibility criterion (with or without the exceptions) to be considered for an all-way stop control.
These are briefly described below.

         Volume: The combined volume from all approaches must equal 300 units per hours for
         eight hours in one day, and that the minor street must equal one-third of the total
         entering volume, for the same eight hours of that day.

         Collision: The total number of reported collisions averages at least three or more per
         year, for at least two years. These collisions must be of the type that can be corrected by
         a multi-way stop sign.

        Visibility: If a significant visibility problem exists at an intersection for a travel distance of
        less than 150 feet, and cannot be corrected by other means (trimming vegetation).

        Neighborhood Circulation: Traffic volumes may be reduced by 60% for all the above
        values if the these three conditions are met: 1) neither street is an arterial street, 2) there is
        not a stop sign or traffic signal within 600 feet of the study intersection and 3) the stop sign
        installation is compatible with the overall traffic circulation within the neighborhood.

        Special Conditions: Traffic volumes may also be reduced to 60% of the overall values if
        other measures have not been effective in regulating crossing safety for pedestrians,
        bicyclists, or motorists within 600 feet of a school, park or playground, community facility,
        or on a steep grade.

For the Colusa Avenue segment, the traffic volumes were reduced by 60% based on the
neighborhood circulation and special conditions criteria, with the street located near a school, and
the all-way stop control being consistent with the traffic flow and circulation of the
neighborhood.


CORRIDOR ANALYSIS

Colusa Avenue, between Rockway Avenue and Susan Drive

Colusa Avenue, south of Susan Drive, is flat and relatively straight, presenting a scenario for
speeding vehicles. To aid in calming traffic on the beginning of the study segment, a speed lump
is recommended 175 feet north of Rockway Avenue, halfway between Rockway Avenue and the
mid-block crosswalk.

Colusa Avenue/Susan Drive

Colusa Avenue approaching Susan Drive is relatively flat in both directions, however there are
horizontal curves just south and north of the intersection limiting visibility for drivers turning out
of Susan Drive. To aid in increasing corner visibility, red curb is recommended on Colusa Avenue,
for at least 50 feet in advance of the Susan Drive intersection, and on Susan Drive, for at least 15
feet in advance of the intersection. Alternatively, cross-hatched bulbout can also be painted at
the intersection corners to reduce the corner turning radii and turning speeds. In the long-term,
the painted bulbouts can be replaced with bulbouts with curbs that extend the sidewalk.

Colusa Avenue, between Susan Drive and Errol Drive

To address not only concerns from residents but also recent speed surveys showing vehicle
speeds of 30 mph, exceeding the posted speed limit by 5 mph on this roadway segment, three
equally spaced speed lumps are recommended along the roughly 1,000-foot segment of Colusa
Avenue between Susan Drive and Errol Drive.

Colusa Avenue/Errol Drive

The approach to Errol Drive from Colusa Avenue in both directions is on a horizontal curve,
presenting visibility concerns for drivers turning out of Errol Drive. To aid in increasing corner
visibility, red curb is recommended on Colusa Avenue, for at least 50 feet in advance of the Errol
Drive intersection, and on Errol Drive, for at least 15 feet in advance of the intersection.
Alternatively, cross-hatched bulbout can also be painted at the intersection corners to reduce the
corner turning radii and turning speeds. In the long-term, the painted bulbouts can be replaced
with bulbouts with curbs that extend the sidewalk

Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue

At the Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue intersection, the all-way stop criteria were applied to
evaluate the potential for stop signs on all approaches (currently only the Eureka Avenue
approach is stop-controlled). The results of the volume data analysis indicate a much higher
percentage of traffic on Colusa Avenue than on Eureka Avenue. With the 60% reductions in traffic
permitted in the City's NTMP, the intersection does not meet the criteria to install an all-way stop
sign due to the large difference in traffic volumes on the two streets. The minor street volume is
still below the 1/3 criterion in the NTMP. It is important to note that where unwarranted, multi-
way stop signs may actually increase vehicle speeds, and may further decrease driver compliance.
For these reasons, other treatments should be considered before all-way stop signs are installed
at unwarranted locations. Analysis results are presented in Appendix B.

The collision history criterion was not met at this intersection as the collisions reported did not
occur at this intersection during this period of time. Of the 11 collisions reported along the
corridor during the 5 year period, 4 occurred near the Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue intersection.
Four collisions were reported in 2009; however only one collision was reported in 2008. For the
criterion to be met, three collisions per year which could be corrected with multi-way stop signs
would need to occur within two consecutive years.

The last criterion, visibility, point to areas where visibility may obstruct the driver's view of
oncoming traffic. At the Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue intersection, motorists turning left from
eastbound Eureka Avenue to northbound Colusa Avenue have limited visibility due to the crest
vertical curve at the top of the Eureka Avenue approach to Colusa Avenue. Coupled with the
northbound approach horizontal curve, this intersection presents a visibility concern that cannot
be corrected through tree-trimming or other non NTMP-measures. Therefore, an all-way stop
sign is recommended at the Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue intersection.

Colusa Avenue, between Eureka Avenue and north of Hotchkiss Avenue

Between Hotchkiss and Eureka Avenues, Colusa Avenue narrows to 30 feet, and presents a
combination of horizontal and vertical curves that affect driver visibility in both directions. This
road narrowing also leads to increases in sideswiped vehicles parked on-street. Residents raised
concerns that vehicles that park on-street often block the pedestrian sidewalk to reduce their risk
of sideswipe.

To improve driver visibility and pedestrian walkability, red curb is recommended for the downhill
portion of Colusa Avenue around the curved roadway sections (see Figure 2), as well as centerline
striping with Botts Dots.      The centerline roadway striping will delineate the roadway and
encourage drivers to stay within their travel lane. The centerline striping will be coupled with
"SLOW" pavement markings and "curve ahead/winding road" warning signs and advisory speed
limit sign for downhill traveling vehicles. The red-curb will also ensure sidewalk accessibility is
provided for pedestrian use. It is estimated that this will result in loss of 9 on-street parking
spaces.

Speed lumps are also recommended north of the curve to calm traffic on this roadway section.
These measures seek to improve the walkability, reduce collisions, and reduce vehicle speeds.

Colusa Avenue, Terrace Drive

Vehicles traveling north on Colusa, making a left turn onto Terrace Drive, have limited sight
distance to oncoming westbound-traveling vehicles.        To improve the sight distance at this
intersection, 60 feet of red-curb is recommended on Terrace Drive.

Vehicles traveling southbound on Colusa, approaching the Terrace Drive intersection, often reach
high speeds are they begin decelerating towards and down Colusa Avenue. To slow traffic and
discourage drivers from taking the corner at high speeds, striping improvements, including

hatching, and either AC-curb or raised Botts Dots, are recommended to delineate the curb
extension.


RECOMMENDATIONS

The goal of this study is to present measures that address concerns raised along Colusa Avenue.
The City currently has approximately $35,000 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 improvements along Colusa
Avenue.

Table 1 summarizes the Tier 1 and Tier 2 measures described in the previous section that could be
considered along this segment, along with their rough order of magnitude cost.

Based on the City's current budget for improvements along Colusa Avenue, and the
recommended goals of this traffic calming study, the following combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2
near-term measures are suggested along Colusa Avenue. These improvements are identified on
Figure 2.

Recommended Near-Term Tier 1 Measures

    ·     Intersection narrowing features, including cross-hatching, at Colusa Avenue / Terrace
          Drive (southbound direction onto Colusa Avenue)
    ·     Red curb striping for 15 to 25 feet along Colusa Avenue in advance of Susan Drive, Errol
          Drive, Hotchkiss Avenue.
    ·     Red curb and centerline striping for approximately 200 feet on the south/west side of
          Colusa Avenue on the horizontal curves
              o   north of Eureka Avenue
              o   north of Hotchkiss Avenue
    ·     All-way stop sign at Colusa Avenue/Eureka Avenue

Recommended Near-Term Tier 2 Measures

    ·     Speed lumps along Colusa Avenue at the following locations:
              o   One speed lump halfway between Rockway Avenue and the midblock crosswalk
              o   Three speed lumps between Susan Drive and Errol Drive
              o   Two speed lumps between Eureka Avenue and Hotchkiss Avenue
    ·     Raised AC curb at the southwest corner of Colusa Avenue / Terrace Drive.

The approximate cost for these improvements is detailed in Table 2.

While the above measures are proposed to calm traffic by reducing vehicle speeds on Colusa
Avenue, they may also reduce vehicle volumes as well. Based on nationally-conducted traffic
calming evaluations, speed lumps are shown to reduce vehicle volumes by approximately 20%.
This reduction in vehicle volumes on Colusa Avenue may cause some vehicles to divert to other
parallel streets, such as Ashbury Avenue or Pomona Avenue.

Alternative Near-Term Tier 1 and Tier 2 Measures

As an alternative to the near-term Tier 1 and Tier 2 measures described above, the following can
also be considered:

    ·   Speed tables instead of speed humps at the six locations described above
    ·   Cross-hatched bulbouts at the corner of intersections of Colusa Avenue with Susan Drive
        and Errol Drive

Recommended Long-Term Tier 1 and Tier 2 Measures

As additional funds become available, long-term solutions may include the following:

    ·   Speed feedback signs on Colusa Avenue, south of Susan Drive (approximate cost =
        $5,000 - $10,000)
    ·   Enhanced crosswalk and curb ramps at the mid-block crosswalk south of Susan Drive
        (approximate cost - $20,000 - $50,000)
    ·   Bulbouts at the corner of intersections of Colusa Avenue with Susan Drive and Errol Drive
        (approximate cost - $15,000 to $25,000 per corner)
    ·   Evaluation and implementation of sidewalk improvements
