BUILDING SITE AND SURROUNDINGS

The site is approximately 47,807 square feet (1.1 acres) comprised of an existing 24,242 square
foot building and 23,565 square foot surface parking lot. The site is bounded by Apgar Street to
the southeast, West MacArthur Boulevard to the south, San Pablo Avenue to the west, Adeline
Street to the northwest, and 39th Street to the north. The building was historically used as a GMC
truck showroom and repair facility until the 1980s, then converted to various small commercial
enterprises, most notably Maz Auto Glass in the 1990s and early 2000s. In recent years, the
building has been used for storage and minor business uses which utilize a very small portion of
the building and site.

Adjacent properties to the east include James Auto Repair, an industrial auto-repair shop at 1047
39th Street, and City Crossing, a 19-unit townhome apartment project at 1000-1036 Apgar Street.
Both neighboring properties are in Oakland. Across 39th Street to the north is the location of the
proposed Madison Park Financial project at 3900 Adeline Street, a 101-unit residential mixed
use development approved by the City of Emeryville and expected to break ground in 2014. To
Planning Commission Staff Report

the west across Adeline Street are Avalon Senior Housing, a 67-unit apartment building owned
and managed by EBALDC at 3850 San Pablo Avenue, and Adeline Place, a 36-unit mixed use
residential condominium project at 3801 San Pablo. To the southwest across the "star
intersection" is Lanesplitter Pizza, a commercial project funded in part by the Emeryville
Redevelopment Agency. To the south across West MacArthur Boulevard is 3706 San Pablo
Avenue, a City of Emeryville-owned vacant site currently undergoing a developer selection
process for development of mixed income family housing (the former Golden Gate Lock and
Key site). See Sheet A0.2 for photographs that show the neighborhood context.

San Pablo Avenue Green Stormwater Spine Project

A "rain garden" is proposed in the wide roadway area on the north side of West MacArthur
Boulevard/Apgar Street just east of San Pablo Avenue adjacent to the site. This is part of the
"San Pablo Avenue Green Stormwater Spine" project sponsored by the San Francisco Estuary
Partnership (SFEP). The Spine Project is a pilot project and model for Bay Area municipalities
implementing "green" infrastructure projects as part of their stormwater management efforts.
The Spine Project will design, build, and monitor an array of low impact development (LID)
projects distributed along 12.5 miles of San Pablo Avenue in Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley,
Albany, El Cerrito, Richmond, and San Pablo. The Design Team, led by the civil engineering
firm Wilsey-Ham, Inc., has prepared schematic designs based on existing conditions and
constraints. These are in the process of refinement by cities, adjacent property owners, and
community members. The Emeryville City Council is expected to review draft design and other
associated legal documents associated with Spine projects in the City of Emeryville, including
the rain garden fronting this "Maz" Building project in September 2013. Construction is
estimated to begin in late fall/early winter of 2013.

The applicant is not responsible for design or construction of this rain garden project. The
individual cities along the Stormwater Spine will be responsible for the final design and
construction of projects lying within their jurisdiction. However, the applicant will be
responsible for its maintenance in perpetuity beginning two years after its construction
(Condition of Approval Number IV.D.4). The first two years of maintenance will be done by the
City through funds provided by the SFEP. The rain garden design will not come separately to the
Planning Commission for comments. However, Commission may provide comments on the
design of the rain garden at this time, which will be forwarded to the Emeryville City Council.

Star Intersection

In January 2012, the City received a $450,000 "Safe Routes to Transit" grant for improvements
to the "star intersection" and San Pablo Avenue between West MacArthur Boulevard and 40th
Street. The exact scope of work will be finalized in the design phase. A Request for Proposals
(RFP) was released in December 2012 incorporating the results of a traffic study of San Pablo
vehicular circulation and revised timing of signals along San Pablo that was developed through
the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's Program for Arterial System Synchronization. In
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 4

January five proposals were submitted in response to the RFP, and on February 19, 2013 the City
Council approved a contract with HQE for engineering design services for the project. Design
work is currently underway. As a condition of approval, the applicant will contribute $50,000 to
the intersection improvements as the project will be one of the direct beneficiaries. (Condition of
Approval Number IV.C.2)

City of Oakland Jurisdiction

The 3800 San Pablo Avenue site is about 75% in Emeryville and 25% in Oakland. The existing
Maz Building is located entirely in Emeryville. The Oakland portion of the site is vacant, used
for surface parking, and fronts on West MacArthur Boulevard/Apgar Street. San Pablo Avenue
and a portion of West MacArthur Boulevard are state highways under Caltrans jurisdiction. The
site is comprised of the following parcels:

Emeryville parcels:

       APN 049-0952-007 (approximately 34,368 square feet ­ this is the main parcel with the
         existing Maz building)
       APN 012-0952-024 (approximately 100 square feet - vacant)

Oakland parcels (all vacant):

       APN 012-0952-025 (approximately 7,465 square feet)
       APN 049-0952-004 (approximately 2,320 square feet)
       APN 049-0952-006 (approximately 1,968 square feet)

The City of Oakland has agreed that Emeryville may take the lead on all planning and building
permits as well as environmental review. This agreement includes applying Emeryville's
Planning Regulations on the entire site. The City of Oakland will be provided with both planning
and building permit plans for review and comment prior to issuance, as well as any project
related studies.

The permitting, inspection, and approval of any public improvements within the public right-of-
way in Oakland (e.g. Apgar Street, West MacArthur Boulevard) will be administered by the City
of Oakland. The permitting, inspection, and approval of any public improvements within the
public right-of-way in Emeryville (e.g. West MacArthur Boulevard, San Pablo Avenue, Adeline
Street, and 39th Street) will be administered by the City of Emeryville. The two cities will
coordinate and cooperate with each other concerning these public improvements. Emeryville
will take the lead in any such coordination and in any necessary coordination and permitting
from Caltrans.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project includes reuse of the existing 25,000 square foot building for commercial uses and
construction of a five-story residential building consisting of 105 rental apartment units and a
parking structure on the existing surface parking lot to the east. The existing commercial
structure would be largely retained and rehabilitated and the parking structure would serve both
the commercial and residential uses.

Circulation and Parking

A two-level parking structure providing 107 spaces would be constructed on the rectangular
eastern portion of the site (See Site Plan, Sheet A2.0 and Building Section, Sheet A4.2). Fifty-
five spaces will be assigned for commercial and residential guest uses on the first level and 52
spaces for residential units on the second level. There is no internal ramp circulation between the
two parking levels. Level 2 has one vehicular access point on 39th, which is a gated ramp that
tenants with parking spaces will get a remote control to open. The lower level has entrances on
39th and Apgar. See Sheet A0.3 for Circulation diagram.

The garage would also include approximately 12 secure covered bicycle parking spaces for
residential use, and there would be approximately 21 secure bicycle parking spaces on each
residential floor and at least 20 on the residential level of the parking structure. At least 10 public
bicycle parking spaces will be provided on the adjacent sidewalks (See Sheet L.2.0). The
Adeline and 39th Street frontages would include a lobby with a stairwell and elevators to the
residential structure above. Approximately 1,050 square feet of live-work space is provided
along West MacArthur Boulevard.

A trash and recycling area is provided along 39th Street and a medium sized loading space is
provided just south of the trash area. (See Sheet A2.0)

Commercial and Residential Uses

The existing ground level space will be used for a commercial uses such as retail and restaurant.
Although the project has not identified exact tenants at this time, potential uses include a brew
pub and a grocery store. A 1,050 square foot common gallery area is also proposed at the core of
the building. It is anticipated to be used to highlight local arts and artists, and to function as a
common area for commercial and residential uses.

The residential building would consist of five-stories over the parking garage with 21 units per
floor. Each floor will have a mix of studio, one- and two- bedroom units and one four bedroom
unit. See Sheet A2.1 for a typical floor plan. The project will provide a total of 45 studios, 15
"nested" studios, 5 one-bedroom units, 15 "nested" one-bedroom units, 20 two-bedroom units
and 5 four-bedroom units. See Sheets A5.0 and A5.1 for different unit types. Studios are 420
square feet; "nested" studios are 520 square feet, one-bedroom units are 700 square feet; "nested
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 6

one-bedroom units are 590 square feet; two-bedroom units are 960 square feet and 4-bedroom
units are 1,600 square feet. The project also provides a roof deck that includes amenities such as
a BBQ area, communal tables and a sunbathing area. The area will also be used to for future
solar panel installation. See Sheet A2.2.

Design and Landscaping

The existing structure would be largely retained and rehabilitated with seismic upgrades, a new
roof, and improvements to modernize the shell. Two bays of the northern portion of the building
would be removed for this area to be incorporated into the residential building. The existing
façade would be mostly retained. The new residential building is a seven level building that will
employ two color horizontal corrugated metal siding while the garage levels will be concrete
with wood formwork finish. Hung balconies with perforated metal guard rails are provided
within units on the east and west elevation. See Sheets A4.0 and A4.1 for elevations and Sheets
A0.5 and A0.6 for renderings. The building will be 75 feet high.

The project will create a plaza area along Adeline Street that includes two new street trees,
curbside planting and raised planter beds and a new water sculpture. The plaza will also include
a seating area with tables along with festival lights. See Sheet L2.0. New bike racks will be
provided along both the Adeline Street and San Pablo Avenue frontages. The southern project
frontage includes a rain garden that provides stormwater treatment. As noted above, this rain
garden will not be designed or constructed by the applicant but will be maintained by the
applicant beginning two years after it is constructed.

Two street trees along 39th Street will be removed as part of the project and three new Chinese
Pistache street trees will be installed - two along Adeline Street and one along 39th Street.
Attached is an arborist report. Per the City's Urban Forestry Ordinance, street trees may be
removed provided that the applicant installs a replacement tree of the same diameter as each tree
to be removed and pays the replacement value of each tree. The trees to be removed are 25
millimeters (or 0.98 inches) and 29 millimeters (or 1.14 inches) in diameter. The applicant will
be installing three new 24 inch box street trees. The applicant will also be required to pay the
replacement value of the trees to be removed, which is appraised at a total value of $270.

CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PLAN

The Land Use Diagram (Figure 2-2) classifies the project site for "Mixed Use with Residential"
use, which is described as (Section 2.4): "One or more of a variety of residential and non-
residential uses including but not limited to offices, retail and hotel." The project is consistent
with this description as it provides multi-unit residential uses as well as a variety of commercial
uses. The site also falls under the "Neighborhood Retail Overlay" area in the Land Use Diagram
(Figure 2-2), which is described to be "intended for stores, offices, services, and restaurants/cafes
that serve the local community" where "a majority of the ground floor use and a substantial
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 7

portion of the frontage along any public street is devoted to these uses." The project is also
consistent with this description.

General Plan goals (G) and policies (P) that are particularly germane, and with which the project
is consistent, include:

LU-G-1         An overall balance of uses ­ Employment, residential, cultural, destination and
               local retail ­ as well as a full range of amenities and services necessary to
               support a vibrant community.

LU- P-1         Land uses will be consistent with the Land Use Classifications in section 2.4 and
               the Land Use Diagram, Figure 2-2.

LU-P-5         Retail uses will be concentrated in areas with Neighborhood or Regional Retail
               overlays, near neighborhood centers, and in the Emeryville Marketplace.

UD-P-46        Street trees shall be provided on City streets where feasible. Street trees shall be
               planted in a row along the curb, between the vehicle roadway and sidewalk,
               unless this is physically impossible due to constraints such as underground water
               or sewer lines.

UD-P-47        Streetscape landscaping shall follow Bay-Friendly Landscaping guidelines and
               serve the dual purpose of treating stormwater runoff and providing shade and
               beauty to the urban realm.

UD-P-70        Street level uses should reinforce neighborhood center streets and allow a
               vertical mix of a diverse range of land uses including offices, hotels and
               residential uses compatible with neighborhood centers.

UD-P-72        Public space and plazas for gathering and expanded ground floor retail activities
               are encouraged. These elements enhance the pedestrian realm and provide
               opportunities for social interaction.

CSN-P-27       The City encourages developers to reuse existing historic or architecturally
               significant structures.

CSN-P-10       New development is required to incorporate source control, site design, and
               storm water treatment to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff.

CSN-P-11       Exterior uses of water for landscaping and other purposes shall be reduced to
               minimize or eliminate runoff and water waste.
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)

CSN-P-33       In order to reduce light pollution and use less energy, lighting (including on
               streets, recreational facilities, and in parking areas) should be designed to
               prevent artificial lighting from illuminating natural resources or adjacent
               residential neighborhoods.

CSN-P-44       The City will continue to require development projects to implement on-site
               stormwater management measures through the City's development permit
               process.

ST-P-5         The City shall encourage, promote, practice, and where feasible, require Bay-
               Friendly landscaping practices as defined in the Bay-Friendly Landscape
               Guidelines, Sustainable Practices for Landscape Professionals.

The Project has been designed to comply with these goals and policies and is therefore consistent
with the General Plan.

CONFORMITY TO LAND USE REGULATIONS:

Zoning Districts and Use:

The zoning for the site is "Mixed Use with Residential South" (MURS) and Neighborhood Retail
Overlay (NR), which allow for a variety of commercial uses as well as multi-unit residential use.
As the site is over one acre, a mix of uses is required, one of which must be residential; the
project complies with this requirement. The applicant has not yet identified tenants for the
commercial space. Anticipated uses include a grocery store, a brew pub, other retail uses and
potential office space. Some of these uses are permitted by right in the MURS/NR district, and
some require a conditional use permit. However, since the site is over one acre, the entire project
requires a conditional use permit (Section 9-3.303(b)(2)b.)

The site is also located in the TH Transit Hub Overlay Zone (see "Parking and Loading" below)
and the PP Pedestrian Priority Overlay Zone (see "Design Guidelines" below).

Residential Density:

The maximum residential density for the site is 85 units per acre and can be increased to 100
units per acre with a conditional use permit and the provision of public benefits. The proposed
density is 105 units on an approximately 1.acre site, or 96 units per acre. The project therefore
will need a conditional use permit and will need to provide public benefits as outlined in Section
9-4.204. Per Section 9-4.204(b)(1) bonus points needed for the proposed density is 73 points
(Bonus Amount/ Bonus Increment x 100 or 11/15 x 100 = 73).
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 9

Floor Area Ratio (FAR):

The Floor Area ratio for the site is 2.0 and can be increased to a bonus FAR of 3.0 with a
conditional use permit and the provision of specified public benefits. The proposed FAR for the
project is 2.24. The project therefore will need a conditional use permit and will need to provide
public benefits as outlined in Section 9-4.204. Per Section 9-4.204(b)(1) bonus points needed for
the proposed FAR is 24 points (Bonus Amount/ Bonus Increment x 100 or 0.24/1.0 x 100 = 24).
Height:

The site falls within the 55 foot height district and can be increased to a bonus height of 75 feet
with a conditional use permit and the provision of specified public benefits. The proposed height
of the building is 75 feet. The project therefore will need a conditional use permit and will need
to provide public benefits as outlined in Section 9-4.204. Per Section 9-4.204(b)(1) bonus points
needed for the proposed height is 100 points (Bonus Amount/ Bonus Increment x 100 or 20/20 x
100 = 100).

Bonus Points

Pursuant to Section 9-4.204 (b)(3), it is not necessary to earn separate points for bonuses in each
category, i.e. FAR, density and height. As outlined above, the category in which the maximum
bonus points are required is height where the applicant requires 100 points for the proposed
height.

The applicant has identified the following features as potential sources of bonus points with staff
response in italics:

       Neighborhood Center (up to 35 points): the commercial space located within the NR
       Neighborhood Retail Overlay Zone is expected to meet the requirements of section 9-
       3.404 to qualify for these points. (Table 9-4.204(c), item (10))

       Staff believes that the project qualifies for 35 bonus points as at least one commercial
       space will have at least 30 feet of depth and a ceiling height of at least 12 feet. In
       addition, the project provides for a vent shaft adequate for a kitchen flue and for a grease
       interceptor. These have also been included as a condition of approval. (Condition of
       Approval Number III.A.11)

       Energy Efficiency (up to 35 points): the project will exceed the California Energy Code
       by 20 per cent. (Table 9-4.204(c), item (5))

       The applicant has made a commitment to exceed the California Energy Code by 20 per
       cent thereby earning 35 points. Condition of Approval Number III.A.10 memorializes this
       commitment and will be verified during plan check of the construction drawings.
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 10

         Significant Structures (up to 35 points): If a project entails adaptive reuse of an entire
         significant structure then it qualifies for 35 points. (Table 9-4.204(c), item (15))

         The project is an adaptive reuse of the "Maz" building which is a significant structure
         for a variety of commercial uses and therefore earns 35 points.

         Under the above three categories, the project earns a total of a 105 bonus points pursuant
         to Section 9-4.204(c), and therefore qualifies for the bonus height, density and FAR.

Parking and Loading:

The proposal includes 55 spaces for commercial parking and 52 spaces for residential parking.
However, approximately 6 commercial spaces and 6 residential spaces are considered
substandard as they are adjacent to a wall or back into the public right of way. (See attached
traffic report). The applicant anticipates a variety of commercial uses including general retail and
a grocery store brew hub. The parking requirement for all retail uses is 3 spaces per 1,000 square
feet whereas for restaurant uses the requirement is 8 spaces per 1,000 square feet. For this reason
parking analysis includes two scenarios: one that includes 5,000 square feet of restaurant use and
one that assumes all uses to be retail only. Residential parking remains the same under both
scenarios.

The tables below outline calculation for the project under two the two scenarios. Pursuant to
Section 9-4.404(f), the minimum parking requirement for nonresidential uses is 33% below the
estimated demand and for residential uses the minimum is the same as the estimated demand; for
all uses, the maximum parking allowed is 10% above the estimated demand. As the project is
located in Transit Hub (TH) overlay district, all required parking is reduced by 50 per cent.

The required residential parking in both scenarios calculates to be between 74 and 81 spaces,
which includes 61 to 67 resident spaces and 13 to 14 guest parking spaces. As the project
provides 52 resident parking spaces, and the minimum is 61, it is deficient by nine spaces and
therefore requires a conditional use permit for parking less than the minimum. In order to
approve the conditional use permit the Commission needs to make findings that adequate
measures are put in place to reduce parking demand and that the reduction of spaces will not
result in overflow parking impacts on adjacent uses (Section 9-4.404(g)(1)). Staff believes that
these findings can be made, as the project provides more bicycle parking than required (see
discussion below) and the target population is a younger age group that tends to favor non-auto
means of transportation for physical, cultural and economic reasons.

The required commercial parking lies between 16 and 26 in Scenario I (No restaurant use) and
between 20 and 33 in Scenario II (5000 sq. ft. of restaurant use). The project provides 55 parking
spaces on the lower level, of which 13 will be designated for residential guest parking and the
remainder of 42 spaces will be commercial spaces. Since the highest maximum parking allowed
of the various commercial scenarios is 33 spaces, the project exceeds the amount of commercial
parking allowed by at least nine spaces, and therefore requires a conditional use permit to allow
more parking than that allowed by the regulations. In order to grant a such a conditional use
permit, the Commission must make findings that the applicant has demonstrated that the
additional parking is required to meet the anticipated demand and that provision of more parking
will not adversely affect transit, bicycle or pedestrian access to the site. Staff believes that these
findings can be made. The applicant has had experience developing other mixed use projects in
urban environments that shows that anticipated uses such as grocery stores and restaurant uses
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 13

generate more auto traffic and are more likely to be successful if adequate auto parking is
available. For example the applicant built a similar project at 5800 3rd Street in San Francisco
that included 137 residential units above a Fresh & Easy grocery (14,800 square feet) and two
restaurants (roughly 4,800 square feet). The project was located at a Muni light rail stop and
included 44 parking spaces dedicated for the commercial uses that were located at a separate
level from residential parking. Despite its location near a transit station, at peak
shopping/restaurant hours parking was not adequate. One restaurant went out of business
because of too little parking and the other threatened to leave. In this example, the applicant had
to build a 75-space surface parking lot adjacent to the project and provide adequate signage to
retain their commercial tenants. The applicant has found that co-locating a grocery story type
use with eating establishments creates a parking demand as people tend not take transit or use
bicycles while going grocery shopping. Therefore, commercial parking that exceeds the City's
requirement is necessary.

In addition, the proposed parking for both commercial and residential uses occur within a
common two level garage so that the additional commercial parking does not change the number
of curb cuts needed for the project that might otherwise potentially adversely impact pedestrian
and bicycle access.

The parking stalls are 8.5 feet by 18 feet and aisle width is 24 feet which meet the minimum
requirements. The parking garage is also screened where possible by inclusion of live-work
space area. The project is also providing 3 electric vehicle charging stations on the second
parking level that meets the Electric Vehicle Charging Station requirement (Section 9-4.406(l))

Loading: Section 9-4.409(a) requires one small loading space for the residential use and one
medium space for the commercial uses. In addition, Section 9-4.409c allows the Commission to
modify the number and size of loading spaces because of the nature of the uses or design of the
project.

The applicant is proposing one loading zone within the site and one on-street loading zone on
39th Street. The traffic report states that the on-site loading area within commercial area would be
sufficient for full size vans but not for larger delivery vehicles. However, the loading zone on
39th Street would be sufficient for residential needs as well as for commercial deliveries for small
retailers. The report recommends that 39th Street loading zone be 35 feet long and that the
parking bay on West MacArthur Boulevard adjacent to accommodate large trucks. This has been
included as a Condition of Approval. (Site Plan Recommendation 12).

Bicycle Parking: Residential use will trigger 3 short term bicycle spaces (one per every 4 guest
auto parking spaces) and 105 long term bicycle spaces (one covered space for each dwelling
unit). The project provides 105 resident bicycle parking spaces with 21 spaces on each floor. In
addition, the resident garage level provides bike lockers for approximately 38 bicycles.
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 14

For commercial uses, one short-term bicycle parking space and one long-term bicycle parking
space is required for each 10 automobile parking spaces, with a minimum of two short-term and
two long-term spaces. Under both scenarios (restaurant and non-restaurant use), this calculates to
2 to 3 short term spaces and 2-3 long term spaces. The project provides 10 short-term bicycle
spaces on the San Pablo Avenue and Adeline Street frontages. This meets the requirements of
both commercial and residential short term bicycle parking spaces.

However, the traffic report recommends a total of 15 short-term bicycle spaces and 8 to 10 long
term spaces for commercial patrons and tenants be provided. This has been included as a
Condition of Approval Number VI.A1.b.

Open Space:

Section 9-4.303 requires new multi-unit residential buildings to provide a minimum of 60 square
feet of open space per dwelling unit consisting of 40 square feet of private open space and 20
square feet of common open space. Where infeasible to provide private open space, common
open space may be substituted for private open space at a ratio of 2:1. Fifty seven units are
provided with either patios at the podium level or balconies that meet the minimum
requirements. As common open space can be substituted for private open space, 48 units will
trigger additional common open space. Total common open space required with substitution is
5,940 square feet (57 x 20 + 48 x100). The project provides a total of 5,991 square feet in the
form of a plaza on Adeline Street (2,400 sq. ft.), common gallery space (1,053 sq. ft.), a podium
dog run (1,818 sq. ft.) and a roof deck (720 square feet). In addition, Adeline Plaza is large
enough to accommodate the minimum dimension requirement for common open space as it can
accommodate a 25 feet by 25 feet square laid flat. (At least one common open space area must
meet these dimensions). Additionally, all private open spaces also meet the minimum dimension
of a 5 foot by 6 foot rectangle laid flat. The project, therefore meets, the City's open space
requirements.

Trash and Recycling:

The project meets the requirements of Section 9-4.704 by providing a trash, recycling and
composting storage area that is indoors, adjacent to a street (39th Street) and the amount of space
for recycling materials is as large as space for trash.

Significant Structure:

The existing building qualifies as a significant structure as defined in Section 9-5.1211(a). The
applicant proposes to reuse the building and add a new building. The proposal will involve
removal of one interior bay of the existing building along 39th Street, but the applicant proposes
to retain the entire façade along 39th Street. This does not qualify as "demolition", which is
defined in Section 9-5.1211(b) as "to remove or destroy all or part of any structure to an extent
of more than 75% of the replacement cost of the structure, not including foundation, immediately
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 15

prior to destruction, or to remove or destroy features of a significant structure such that it would
no longer qualify as a significant structure." Therefore, the project will not require approval of a
conditional use permit by the City Council for demolition of a significant structure. Pursuant to
Section 9-5.1203(a), the project will require a minor conditional use permit for preservation and
reuse of a significant structure (which is considered a part of the overall project approvals to be
decided by the Planning Commission), with the finding "That the proposed project will retain
and enhance all or most of the features of the structure that make it significant." The finding can
be made in this case, and the preservation and reuse of the structure is worth 35 bonus points,
pursuant to Section 9-4.204(c)(15).

Design Guidelines - General:

The project generally complies with the City's Design Guidelines by providing the following:
adequate, Bay-Friendly street landscaping (Guidelines A-11 to A-15); screening loading areas
(Guideline B-4), visually open pedestrian entries (Guideline B-7), using permeable paving (B-9),
locating bicycle parking near entrances (B-10); siting buildings and plazas with seating that
encourage interaction between occupants and passerbys (Guideline C-2); concealing mechanical
equipment (Guideline C-6); a variation in height and massing (Guideline D-3); a variation in roof
levels and use of awnings and canopies (Guideline E-6); including operable windows and
allowing natural ventilation (Guideline E-7), creating a well-defined corner by providing a small
plaza on Adeline Street and San Pablo Avenue (Guideline E-10); using window design and
proportions to add architectural interest (Guideline F-3); devising a color palette that reinforces
building identity (Guideline F-13); providing clear, non-reflective glazing (Guideline F-15); and
providing public open spaces in form of a plaza and seating within a Bay-Friendly landscaped
area (Guidelines G-18, 20, and 23).

Design Guidelines - Area Specific:

The project site falls within the Neighborhood Retail Overlay Zone and the Pedestrian Priority
Overlay Zone. In addition, the Adeline Street frontage is classified as a "Key Green Street" in the
General Plan. Each of these designations has corresponding guidelines for sidewalk dimensions.
Where multiple designations occur, the Design Guidelines specify that they shall be prioritized
as follows: (1) Neighborhood Centers, (2) Green Streets, (3) Pedestrian Priority. Thus, the
Neighborhood Center guidelines would apply in this case. The project complies with Guidelines
I-5 and I-7 by providing attractive and well landscaped entries and settings to the buildings along
San Pablo Avenue and designing the ground floor space with active uses such as a restaurant and
other retail uses that serve the local community. Guideline I-8 sets a 15-foot minimum sidewalk
width (back of curb to building face) with a 3-foot building entry/public space, an 8-foot
pedestrian pathway, and a 4-foot landscaping/street furniture zone along the curb. As the project
is an adaptive reuse of an existing building and retains the building footprint, it is not possible to
create a 15-foot minimum sidewalk width on all street frontages. The San Pablo Avenue and
Adeline Street frontages maintain an existing configuration that includes a total of 11'9"
sidewalk width with a 6'4" pedestrian pathway and 5'5" of landscaping. The 39th Street frontage
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 16

maintains an 11'10" overall sidewalk width but increases the pedestrian pathway from 6'1" to
7'10" and the landscaped area from 2'7" to 4'. (See Sheet A0.3). The proposed rain garden by
others on the West MacArthur/Apgar frontage will provide ample landscaping between the
sidewalk and curb. Thus, the project generally complies with the Design Guidelines for
Neighborhood Centers and meets the intent of the guidelines if not the exact dimensions.


STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS

The project is subject to the C.3 requirements of the City's National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Permit. The Stormwater plans showing compliance
with C.3 requirements are included in Sheet S. Condition of Approval Number VIII.A-C details
the stormwater compliance requirements.

TRAFFIC REPORT

Fehr and Peers conducted a traffic report the project and concluded that there would be no major
impacts on traffic as a result of the project. (Report attached). The report does include a number
of recommendations regarding site circulation, auto and bicycle parking and loading that have
included as Conditions of Approval VI.A.6 and VI.B.3.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

A traffic report and visual simulations were conducted for the project (attached). On the basis of
these studies, staff has determined that the project qualifies for an exemption under State CEQA
Guideline Section 15332 which applies to in-fill developments. A Planning Commission finding
to this effect is included in the attached Resolution.

STAFF COMMENTS

The project was reviewed at the February 13, 2013 Development Coordinating Committee
meeting and then again at the July 12, 2013. All staff comments have been addressed.

PLANNING COMMISSION STUDY SESSION COMMENTS AND APPLICANT
RESPONSE

The Planning Commission considered this project at a study session on February 22, 2013.
Outlined below are the comments made by the Commission at the study session followed by a
discussion as to whether these have been addressed in the current plans.

·      In general, the Commissioners felt that the project was an exciting one, and expressed a
       preference for additional two and three bedroom units.
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 17

       The proposed project has five more 2-bedroom units than before (25 as compared to
       20), and five 4-bedroom units. The total number of studios and 1-bedroom units has
       been reduced from 80 to 75, although the number of studios has increased from 50 to
       60, and the number of 1-bedrooms has been reduced from 30 to 15. It should be noted
       that 15 of the studios are "nested" and would function as small 1-bedroom units.

·      An art gallery was suggested as a potential use for the ground space.

       A gallery space has been included which will also function as a common area for both
       the commercial tenants and the residents.

·      A green roof was suggested for the existing building in order to mitigate the glare that
       would be seen from the proposed residential building and to provide open space.

       This is not included. However a roof deck has been included on the new building and
       provides open space for residential use. The roof of the existing building will be
       readied for future photo-voltaic solar panels.

·      Concern was expressed regarding the massing of the building and that a few more
       elevations were needed in order to accurately assess its appearance.

       The plans now include more design details for all elevations including color, materials
       and window details.

·      A more detailed design is needed for the public plaza and in general more open space that
       would be available to the public should be provided.

       This is now included.

·      A suggestion was made to move the residential lobby and the flexible space from the
       south side to the corner of 39th and Adeline Streets in order to shorten the walk to the bus
       stops on 40th Street.

       This has been done.

·      Bike lockers were seen as a better method of providing secured bike parking.

       The project provides both bike lockers at the second parking level as well bike parking
       on each floor.

·      Public improvements and energy efficiency were identified as preferred categories for
       obtaining bonus points for the proposed height, floor area ratio and residential density.
Planning Commission Staff Report
3800 San Pablo Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 18

       The project earns maximum the possible points under the category of "Energy
       efficiency". Other categories of bonus points include preservation of a significant
       structure and Neighborhood Center amenities.

Subject:        Tree Removal and Valuation

Location:       39th St and Adeline

Project:        3800 San Pablo Ave.

Species:        Pistacia chinensis, Photinia x fraseri, Pyrus kawakamii

Assignment:     Arborist was requested to review Existing Tree and Site Demolition Plan and prepare a
                valuation report for trees to be removed.


Summary
Three trees will be removed on 39th St. to accommodate the proposed site modifications. The
Replacement Cost Method was used to value the Photinia and pear. The dead pistache was valued at $0
minus the cost of removal and clean-up. Total value of trees to be removed, including cost of removal
and clean-up, is $270.


Tree and Site Description
All three trees are located in a parkway planting strip on the south side of 39th close to Adeline St.

Dead Chinese Pistache (Pistacia chinensis) ­ The tree has a DBH of 3 ½ inches and is dead. Cause of
death is most likely inhospitable planting location.

Method of Valuation
The Replacement Cost Method was used to appraise the value of the three trees. The Appraised Value
of a landscape plant is based on the cost of replacing a plant of the same or a comparable species and
size in the same place. The Installed Plant Cost is adjusted by the Species, Condition and Location
ratings of the appraised plants to obtain the Adjusted Installed Plant Cost. If the appraised plants are to
be replaced, the costs of plant Removal and Clean-up Costs are added to obtain the Appraised Value. If
the appraised plant is not to be replaced, the Adjusted Installed Plant Cost is the Appraised Value.

Please see supplemental Replacement Cost Method worksheets for Photinia and pear.


Tree Values

Dead Chinese Pistache ­ The tree is valued at $0 minus the cost of removal or -$50

Redleaf Photinia ­ The tree is valued at $130, which includes cost of removal.

Evergreen Pear ­ The tree is valued at $190, which includes cost of removal.

Total Value ­ $270


Recommendations
Any replacement plantings occurring adjacent to hardscape should utilize under pavement treatments
to prevent future hardscape displacement. This includes the use of structural soil and/or 4-6 inches of
clean crushed rock placed at the interface between hardscape and soil.

Date:           August 14, 2013
To:             Miroo Desai, City of Emeryville
From:           Kathrin Tellez, Fehr & Peers
Subject:        3800 San Pablo Avenue (MAZ Building) Transportation Assessment

                                                                                                 WC13-2026


This memorandum presents the results of the transportation assessment for the MAZ Building
redevelopment (Project), including the Project description, analysis parameters, existing
conditions, project conditions, and site plan review.          An assessment of near-term conditions
including redevelopment of adjacent parcels and improvements to the San Pablo Avenue/Adeline
Street intersection is also discussed.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Project site is located at 3800 San Pablo Avenue and 1040 Apgar Street, primarily in the City
of Emeryville but partially in the City of Oakland. The approximately 1.1 acre site, as shown on
Figure 1 (all figures are attached at the end of this document), is currently occupied by an
approximately 24,242 square-foot building and a 23,565 square-foot surface parking lot. As part
of the Project, the existing building would be seismically upgraded and modified to house a
variety of commercial uses, potentially including a neighborhood grocery store, a general retail
store, and a restaurant or yoga studio. Although future tenants for the commercial space have
not yet been identified, the analysis considers the mixture of uses that could occupy that space.
Not all of the existing building would be converted to active use. A lobby to the residential
building, circulation and storage would be incorporated into the final design, resulting in
approximately 17,000 to 20,000 square feet of net rentable square feet.

A two level parking garage would be constructed on the existing surface parking lot, with a five-
story residential building containing approximately 105 units constructed on top of the garage.

Vehicular access to the site would be provided from driveways on 39th Street and Apgar Street.
Although these driveways would allow for all turning movements to the proposed parking areas,
access from the surrounding roadway system would be constrained due to turn restrictions at the
San Pablo Avenue/Adeline Street intersection and from West MacArthur Boulevard (in the case of
the Apgar Street driveway). West MacArthur Boulevard is a one-way westbound roadway in the
immediate vicinity of the Project site. Vehicle access routes to the site are discussed in detail in
the trip description section of this memo.        Access to residential parking supplies would be
provided only from 39th Street, while access to the commercial parking supplies would be
provided from both Apgar Street and 39th Street. A conceptual Project site plan is shown on
Figure 2.

As a separate project, the City of Emeryville proposes to construct a rain garden on the north side
of the West MacArthur Boulevard/Apgar Street intersection, east of San Pablo Avenue and
directly south of the Project site. This improvement is part of the "San Pablo Avenue Green
Stormwater Spine" project sponsored by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership. The area would
function as a stormwater treatment and detention area, as well as a public space to be used by
the community.


ANALYSIS PARAMETERS

Study Area and Analysis Scenarios

The transportation study evaluates weekday evening (4 to 6 PM) and Saturday afternoon (3 to 5
PM) peak periods to coincide with the time-periods when adjacent street traffic demands are
greatest and the Project generates the most traffic. The study addresses existing and near-term
traffic conditions without and with the Project at the following intersections:

    1.   39th Street/Adeline Street

    2.   West MacArthur Boulevard/San Pablo Avenue/Adeline Street ("Star" Intersection)

    3.   West MacArthur Boulevard/Apgar Street

Intersection operations are evaluated for the following scenarios:

    ·    Existing ­ Existing conditions based on recent traffic counts.

    ·    Existing Plus Project ­ Existing condition plus Project-related traffic.
Ms. Miroo Desai

Page 3 of 26




    ·   Near-Term Conditions ­ Near-term conditions considering existing traffic plus anticipated
        traffic from approved developments that could affect the volumes at the study
        intersections. This scenario includes planned improvements at the Star Intersection.

    ·   Near-Term Conditions Plus Project ­ Intersection volumes from the above scenario, plus
        traffic generated by the Project. This scenario includes planned improvements at the Star
        Intersection.

In addition to an assessment of vehicle travel through the area, bicycle and pedestrian circulation
is discussed.

Existing Conditions

This section describes transportation facilities in the Project study area, including the surrounding
roadway network, and transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities in the Project site vicinity. The
Project site is located within a pedestrian priority zone as well as within a transit overlay zone.

Roadway System

San Pablo Avenue is designated as State Route 123 and is a four lane north-south roadway that
connects the City of Oakland at Frank Ogawa Plaza to the community of Rodeo. Left-turn pockets
are generally provided at intersections with a landscaped median, although left-turns are
prohibited at its intersection with Adeline Street.     Though Emeryville, San Pablo Avenue is a
designated transit street. As a transit street, other travel modes are accommodated, but if there
are conflicts between modes, transit takes priority. On-street parking is permitted along portions
of San Pablo Avenue in the Project vicinity, but is time restricted to one or two hours. San Pablo
Avenue is also a designated truck route through the City of Emeryville.

Adeline Street is generally a two lane roadway through Emeryville. Its southwest to northeast
orientation creates skewed intersections along its path. Left-turns from San Pablo Avenue to
Adeline Street are prohibited due to the angles that make these turn movements difficult.
Adeline Street is a designated connector street, meaning that no one mode of travel takes
precedence as automobiles, bicycles, trucks and pedestrians are all accommodated.               Class II
bicycle lanes are provided on Adeline Street through Emeryville and two-hour on-street parking is
provided.

West MacArthur Boulevard is an east-west connector street that begins in Emeryville at Hollis
Street and continues east through Oakland. East of Market Street, MacArthur Street generally
Ms. Miroo Desai
August 14, 2013
Page 4 of 26




provides two travel lanes in each direction with on-street parking. West of Market Street, West
MacArthur Boulevard provides a freeway on-ramp with a direct connection to Interstate-580. The
eastbound and westbound directions of the roadway transition to a one-way one-lane roadway.
Along the Project frontage, West MacArthur Boulevard provides for westbound travel. On-street
parking is provided on the north side of the roadway between Market Street and the Project site.
Turn restrictions at San Pablo Avenue result in West MacArthur Boulevard being discontinuous in
the immediate Project vicinity.

Apgar Street is an east-west two-way two-lane local street that terminates at West MacArthur
Boulevard. A small portion of the roadway is within the City of Emeryville, with the remaining
portion of the roadway in Oakland.           As a primarily residential street, unrestricted on-street
parking is provided within the vicinity of the Project site.

39th Street is an east-west two-way two-lane local street that terminates at Adeline Street. A
small portion of the roadway is within the City of Emeryville, with the remaining portion of the
roadway in Oakland.      Commercial uses are located on the eastern part of the roadway with
residential uses to the east. On the north side of the street, approximately six parking spaces are
restricted to one-hour parking. On the remaining portion of the street, parking is generally
unrestricted.

Existing Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals. Pedestrian facilities
are provided on public roadways adjacent to the site.             In the immediate Project vicinity,
pedestrian crosswalks, push buttons and signals are provided at the signalized intersections. A
two stage crossing is provided across the north side of the San Pablo Avenue/Adeline Street
intersection. Pedestrian crossings are provided across both sides of Adeline Street at San Pablo
Avenue; no pedestrian crossing is provided on the south side of the San Pablo Avenue/Adeline
Street intersection. Several high visibility pedestrian crossings are provided across Adeline Street,
including at 39th Street and Yerba Buena Avenue. Existing pedestrian facilities are shown on
Figure 3.

Bicycle facilities in Emeryville include the following:

    ·   Bike paths (Class I) ­ Paved trails that are separated from roadways. These facilities are
        typically shared with pedestrians, although bicycles must yield to pedestrians.
Ms. Miroo Desai
August 14, 2013
Page 5 of 26




    ·   Bike lanes (Class II) ­ Lanes on roadways designated for use by bicycles through striping,
        pavement legends, and signs. There may or may not be parking allowed on the roadway.

    ·   Bike routes (Class III) ­ Designated roadways for bicycle use by signs only; may or may not
        include additional pavement width for cyclists.

    ·   Bicycle Boulevard ­ A street classification on which bicycles have priority, and which may
        or may not have bike lanes.

Adeline Street has Class II bike lanes through the City of Emeryville. This bike lane connects to
other facilities, including 40th Street, Emery Street/Peralta Street, Hollis Street, south of 40th
Street, Mandela Parkway, and Horton Street. A Class I bike path is under construction from IKEA,
connecting to the Bay Bridge. Existing bicycle facilities in the study area are shown on Figure 3.

Existing Transit Service

The Project site is located in an area well served by transit as it is approximately 800 feet from the
40th Street transit hub, which is served by numerous AC transit lines as well as the free Emery-go-
Round shuttle.     The site is approximately 3/4-mile from the MacArthur BART station, an
approximately 10-15 minute walk or less than five minute bike ride.

AC Transit and Emery-Go-Round connect the study area to neighboring cities in the East Bay as
well as the MacArthur BART Station and Downtown Oakland. Emery-Go-Round provides service
at 10 minute headways during peak hour and 20 minute headways in the off-peak. AC Transit
provides 12 to 20 minute headways during the weekdays. Transit routes in the vicinity of the
Project are shown on Figure 4.

The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system provides regional rail transit service connecting San
Francisco, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, and parts of San Mateo County. From the
MacArthur BART station, direct connections to San Francisco, destinations on the Richmond and
Fremont lines, and the Pittsburgh Bay Point Line are provided. During the peak periods, trains
operate on less than 10 minute headways to/from San Francisco.              Trains run to/from San
Francisco with 15 to 20 minute headways during the off-peak.

Amtrak provides passenger rail service approximate 1.5 miles to the northwest of the study area,
running through the City of Emeryville. Service from the Emeryville Amtrak station provides inter-
regional travel to Sacramento, the Central Valley, Southern California, and Northern California.

Existing Roadway Operations

Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM), evening (4:00 to 6:00 PM), and Saturday afternoon (2:00 to
6:00) peak period intersection vehicle turning movement counts were conducted in September
2012 along the San Pablo Avenue corridor and were supplemented by counts at the local street
intersections closest to the Project site in May 2013. Separate counts of pedestrian and bicycle
activity were also collected. For the study intersections, the single hour with the highest traffic
volumes during the count periods was identified.          For this study, the weekday evening and
Saturday peak hours are the periods with the most traffic flow on area roadways. These time
periods also coincide with when the Project is expected to generate the most vehicle traffic (See
Table 1). The peak hour volumes for weekday evening and Saturday afternoon are presented on
Figure 5 along with the existing lane configuration and traffic control. The traffic count data are
provided in the Appendix.

The operations of roadway facilities for vehicles are typically described with the term level of
service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel
time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels are defined from LOS A, with the best operating
conditions, to LOS F, with the worst operating conditions.            LOS E represents "at-capacity"
operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-
and-go conditions. The City of Emeryville does not have a level of service policy for vehicles, but
strives to achieve a Quality of Service. Quality of Service recognizes that people travel by a variety
of modes, not just in vehicles and that the use of an auto-focused level of service standard does
not address the mobility needs for non-auto roadway users.

Although the City of Emeryville does not have a level of service standard for vehicles, San Pablo
Avenue is a designated State Highway and a designated roadway segment of Alameda County
Transportation Commission (ACTC) Congestion Management Program (CMP) Network. As such,
the level of service standard for this facility is LOS E. Appendix A describes the LOS analysis
methods for vehicles. For the other modes of travel, the delay that people may experience as
they travel along various corridors in the vicinity of the Project site is evaluated.

Results of the existing conditions analysis are presented in Table 2, which shows that the
intersections that provide access to the Project site operate at LOS C or better during both peak
hours for vehicles, including transit vehicles. Bicyclists also experience similar levels of delay as
vehicles, but since bicyclists can typically maneuver to the front of the intersection on a red light,
they can bypass queued vehicles.

For pedestrians traveling along San Pablo Avenue, delays at the unsignalized intersecting side
streets are typically minimal as vehicles must stop and yield to pedestrians and other vehicles. At
the signalized intersection of San Pablo Avenue and Adeline Street, pedestrian delay is largely a
function of when the pedestrian arrives during the traffic signal cycle. On average, pedestrian
delay ranges between 45 and 60 seconds for travel along San Pablo Avenue.

For pedestrians crossing San Pablo Avenue at Adeline, the crossing can be quite indirect and
circuitous, especially for pedestrians with an origin on the south east corner of the intersection
with a destination on the south west corner, as they must cross three legs of the intersection to
make a legal crossing. This total crossing time is over two minutes considering the length of the
crosswalks, not accounting for signal delay which would increase total travel time. The City of
Emeryville has a planned improvement project at this intersection that would provide a crosswalk
on the south leg of the intersection, significantly improving pedestrian mobility across San Pablo
Avenue in the Project area.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES

To estimate conditions with the Project, vehicle trips expected to be added to the roadway system
were combined with existing traffic volumes through the following process:

    1.   Trip Generation ­ The amount of vehicle traffic entering and exiting the Project site was
         estimated.
    2.   Trip Distribution ­ The direction trips use to approach and depart the site was projected.
    3.   Trip Assignment ­ Trips were then assigned to specific roadway segments and
         intersection turning movements.

Trip Generation

Trip generation refers to the process of estimating the amount of vehicular traffic a project might
add to the local roadway network. In addition to estimates of daily traffic, estimates are also
created for the peak one-hour periods during the morning (AM) and evening (PM) commute
hours, when traffic volumes on adjacent streets are typically at their highest. For this Project,
estimates for peak Saturday conditions were also prepared since traffic volumes on San Pablo
Avenue are often higher on Saturdays than weekdays.

The traditional methods commonly used by traffic engineers to calculate the trip generating
potential of mixed-use developments (MXDs) in urban areas with a variety of travel options can
Ms. Miroo Desai

overestimate their traffic impacts because the methods do not accurately reflect the amount of
internal trip linking or the level of trips made by transit, biking, and/or walking. This results in
increased development costs due to oversized infrastructure, skewed public perception of the
likely impacts of development, and resistance to approving smart growth.

The most common method used by traffic engineers is outlined in the Institute of Transportation
                                             th
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9 Edition). This method contains data primarily collected
at suburban, single-use, freestanding sites. This limits the applicability of the data to MXDs, such
as the Project, which is located in a dense walkable urban setting with a mix of land uses and with
nearby local and regional transit service. This method does not adequately account for key
variables that influence travel such as development density and scale, location efficiency, land use
mix, urban design and transit orientation.

Two significant new research studies provide the opportunity to improve the state of practice.
                                       1                                                       2
One study sponsored by the US EPA and another by the Transportation Research Board have
developed means to improve trip generation estimation for MXDs. The two studies examined
over 260 MXD sites throughout the U.S. and, using different approaches, developed new
quantification methods. Fehr & Peers has reviewed the two methods, including the basis,
capabilities, and appropriate uses of each, to produce a new method (MXD+) that combines the
strengths of the two individual advances to best practice. MXD+ recognizes that traffic generation
by mixed-use and other forms of sustainable development relate closely to the density, diversity,
design, destination accessibility, transit proximity, and scale of development. MXD+ improves the
accuracy of vehicle trip estimation and gives planners a tool to rationally balance land use mix
and to incorporate urban design, context compatibility, and transit orientation to create lower
impact development.

The MXD+ methodology starts with ITE trip generation estimates but then adjusts those
estimates to account for the mixed-use and environment characteristics.

Use of the MXD+ methodology requires more input data than a traditional trip generation
application. Data detailing the geographic layout of the site, land use in the surrounding area, and
socioeconomic data of both the site and the surrounding area were collected to inform the MXD+

methodology. Sources used to collect this data include the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission (MTC) travel demand model, Census and American Community Survey (ACS), the Bay
Area Travel Survey (BATS), and the Project site plan.

use on mixed-use smart growth developments , and has been used successfully in multiple
certified EIRs in California.

For 27 mixed-use sites that were surveyed in California and across the country, the ITE
methodology overestimated daily traffic generation by 24 percent and peak hour traffic by 35
percent to 37 percent. The MXD+ method explains 97 percent of the variation in trip generation
among MXDs, compared to 65 percent for the methods previously recommended by ITE. While
remaining slightly (2 percent to 4 percent) conservative to avoid systematically understating
impacts, MXD+ substantially reduces the 35 percent - 37 percent average overestimate of traffic
generation produced by conventional ITE methods. The MXD+ method has been locally validated
to dozens of transit oriented development (TOD) sites in the Bay Area and across the country.
Outputs of this tool include external vehicle trip generation, internal trips, and external
walking/bicycling/transit trips.

Table 1 shows the estimated trip generation for the Project. In terms of ITE trip generation, which
would be the trip generation of the Project if all the land uses were independent and did not
interact with each other or the transportation environment, the Project would generate
approximately 2,180 weekday daily trips, including about 90 morning peak hour and 200 evening
peak hour trips. On a typical Saturday, the Project would generate approximately 2,840 trips,
including 220 during the peak hour. However, there are a number of factors that would reduce
the overall number of trips made by a vehicle to/from this site, including the potential for internal
trips such as a resident of the apartments stopping by the restaurant or grocery store on their

way home. A number of trips are also expected to be walk/bike trips or transit trips. For the
commercial uses, some of the trips could already be on the surrounding roadway system and
would represent an interim stop on an already planned trip.

Based on the MXD+ model, about 10 percent of trips are expected to remain internal to the
proposed Project on a daily basis, with 5 percent internal trips during the morning peak hour and
10 percent during the evening peak hour. About 15 percent of trips would arrive at/depart the
site by walking or biking as the primary model of travel. During peak periods, about 10 percent
of trips would be primarily transit trips, with 5 percent of daily trips made by transit. Application
of the vehicle trip reduction factors results in about 30 percent fewer vehicle trips on a daily basis
as well as during the morning peak hour. During the weekday evening and Saturday peak hours,
a 40 percent vehicle trip reduction as compared to standard ITE rates is expected.

Vehicle trip generation would also be reduced when pass-by trips are considered, such as a non-
resident of the Project stopping at the grocery store on the way home from work at a different
location. When these trips are considered in addition to the MXD+ reductions described above,
the Project is expected to add up to 1,230 daily vehicle trips, including 55 morning peak hour and
90 evening peak hour trips to the regional roadway network. On a Saturday, the Project could
generate up to 1,430 vehicle trips, including 100 peak hour trips. Based on the level of vehicle trip
generation, the evaluation of intersection operations in the vicinity of the site will focus on the
weekday evening and Saturday afternoon peak hours.

Although specific tenants have not yet been identified and the final tenant mix may change from
what is assumed in Table 1, grocery store and restaurant uses tend to generate more trips than
general commercial space and provides an upper limit on the likely trip generating potential of
the Project site such that further analysis would not be necessary when tenants are identified.

Project Trip Distribution and Assignment

Project trip distribution refers to the directions of approach and departure that vehicles would
take to access and leave the site. Estimates of regional Project trip distribution were developed
based on existing travel patterns in the area, as presented on Figure 6. However, given access
constraints to the site due to turn restrictions at the Adeline Street/San Pablo Avenue intersection
and MacArthur Boulevard, depending on the direction of approach or departure, some travel may
be circuitous to the site. Figure 7 shows potential travel routes to the site.

The net new vehicle traffic generated by the Project was then assigned to streets in the local
roadway system for the PM and Saturday peak hours considering the parking access locations for
the commercial and residential portion of the Project as well access limitations at intersections in
the vicinity of the site. The resulting Project trip distribution through for each study intersection is
shown on Figure 8.

Project intersection volumes were added to existing traffic counts, to show Existing Plus Project
traffic conditions. The resulting traffic volumes are shown on Figure 9.

TRAFFIC FORECASTS

Approved developments in the Project vicinity have the potential to increase activity within the
Study area. These developments include:

    ·   Mixed-use project at 3900 Adeline Street
    ·   Affordable housing project at 3706 San Pablo Avenue
    ·   Ambassador Housing project at 36th Street/Peralta Street

The 3900 Adeline Street project, located across the street from the Project site, has been
approved to develop 91 residential units, 10 live-work units, and 1,000 square feet of ground floor
retail. Although the level of development for the affordable housing project on San Pablo Avenue
has not yet been finalized, four development proposals have been submitted to the City of
Emeryville for evaluation. For the purposes of this assessment, the development alternative with
the highest potential for vehicle trip generation was selected for inclusion in the analysis. This
alternative includes 88-residential units and 7,000 square feet of commercial space.                The
Ambassador Housing project includes 69-units.

Vehicle traffic expected to be generated by each of these Project was assigned to the roadway
network to develop Near-term Without Project forecasts.          The potential trip generation was
estimated using a similar method as for Project trips. Vehicle trips expected to be generated by
the Project were then added to estimate Near-term With Project forecasts. The resulting forecasts
are presented on Figure 9.

ROADWAY NETWORK

For the analysis of near-term conditions, planned improvements at the San Pablo Avenue/Adeline
Street/West MacArthur Boulevard intersection were assumed to be in place.                      These
improvements, as shown on Figure 10, would provide two new pedestrian crossings of San Pablo
Avenue ­ one on the south side of Adeline Street and one south of the eastbound approach of
the West MacArthur intersection.

High visibility continental crosswalks will be marked at a number of locations and video detection
for bicyclists will be installed, increasing signal green time when bicyclists are detected to provide
them with sufficient time to traverse the intersection. Bicycle boxes would also be provided on
Adeline Street so that bicyclist can better position themselves at the intersection when they do
need to stop. Advance stop bars will be provided on San Pablo Avenue and Adeline Street,
further separating pedestrian and vehicle movements.

Northbound and southbound left-turns would continue to be prohibited from San Pablo Avenue
to Adeline Street and eastbound and westbound right-turns would also become prohibited from
Adeline Street to San Pablo Avenue.          On the eastbound and westbound Adeline Street
approaches, the existing shared-through left-turn lanes would be converted to left-turn only lanes
and the lanes would operate as lead-lag protected. Overall, no additional vehicle capacity would
be provided. The improvements would enhance pedestrian and bicycle movements through the
intersection.

In the Existing Plus Project scenario, the addition of Project traffic would marginally increase delay
at the study intersections, but they are expected to continue operating at levels similar to existing
conditions. Travel time for other modes in the area is also expected to remain similar to existing
conditions.

In the near-term with the addition of traffic from projects that are expected to be developed in
the next few years and completion of improvements to the Star Intersection, travel time for
passenger vehicles and transit vehicles is expected to decrease for movements on Adeline Street,
but increase slightly for movements on San Pablo Avenue. Overall, average delay experienced by
all users of the intersection would decrease. This is due to providing exclusive left-turn lanes for
eastbound and westbound movements on Adeline Street, protected left-turn phases, an
additional pedestrian crossing, as well as bicycle detection and bike boxes.

eastbound and westbound movements on Adeline Street, protected left-turn phases, an
additional pedestrian crossing, as well as bicycle detection and bike boxes.

With the reduced green time for vehicle on San Pablo Avenue resulting from Star Intersection
improvements, there is a potential for vehicle queues to increase on San Pablo Avenue to
adjacent intersections. However, it is expected that for vehicles traveling southbound, arrivals to
the intersection would be metered by the operation of the 40th Street/San Pablo Avenue
intersection, such that southbound queues would not extend to 40th Street. In the northbound
direction, vehicle flows would also be metered by the 36th and 37th Street intersections.
Although the signalized intersections on San Pablo Avenue between 53rd Street and 35th Street
and the intersections on 40th Street on either side on San Pablo Avenue are operated by three
different jurisdictions, City of Emeryville, City of Oakland and Caltrans, the traffic signal timings
have been coordinated to minimize total travel time through the corridor.                 With the
implementation of the Star Intersection improvements, signal timings would be monitored and
adjusted to best serve the traffic flows and minimize delay for all travel modes through the
intersection. Bicycle travel will remain similar to existing conditions, and pedestrian delay access
across San Pablo Avenue will significantly decrease.


SITE ACCESS, CIRCULATION AND PARKING

This section discusses site access and internal circulation for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, and
emergency vehicles based on the site plan presented previously on Figure 2.               A parking
assessment was also conducted. Site recommendations are presented on Figure 11.

Vehicle Access and Circulation

Vehicle access to the site would be provided from three driveways ­ two on 39th Street and one
on Apgar Street. The westernmost driveway on 39th Street would provide the only access to the
second level of the parking garage which would be restricted to residential use only. The other
two driveways would provide access to the commercial parking supplies. Although the City of
Emeryville Parking Code states that parking areas shall be designed so that a vehicle will not have
to enter a public right-of-way area to move from one location to another within the parking area
(9-4-406 (c) (2) b), as the second level of parking would be resident-only gated access, it is not
expected that many residents would travel through the commercial parking areas to enter or exit
the site. The two driveways on 39th Street would also be very closely spaced (18 feet). As the
driveways are expected to be low volume, vehicle conflicts are expected to be minimal.
Ms. Miroo Desai

Page 17 of 26




         Site Plan Recommendation 1: The space between the two driveways is not of sufficient
         length to accommodate on-street parking and red curb should be installed.

The ramp between the grade level and second level of the parking structure is proposed to be 20
feet wide, per the code requirement. It is not clear from the site plan if the dimension is from the
wall or if there is curb separating the travel way from the sheer wall to prevent vehicles from
hitting the wall.

         Site Plan Recommendation 2: Provide a 12" to 18" curb on each side of the 20-foot
         ramp up to the second parking garage level to permit two-way travel. Without the curb,
         there would not be sufficient clear-way for two way travel of some wider vehicles with
         mirrors.

The commercial driveway may not provide adequate sight distance between exiting automobiles
and pedestrians walking along 39th Street. Based on the position of a typical driver in a vehicle,
the nose of the vehicle will enter the pedestrian realm before the driver is able to see if
pedestrians are present.

         Site Plan Recommendation 3: Maintain landscaping at driveway (shrubs should not be
         higher than approximately 30 inches and tree canopies should be approximately six feet
         from the ground), and install planters or other physical barriers along the Project building
         to direct pedestrians away from the face of the building such that they are more visible to
         vehicles exiting the driveway, improving sight distance. Shifting the pedestrian zone away
         from the building façade to improve visibility would require extending the curb 3 to 6 feet
         on either side of the project driveways.

At the Apgar Street driveway and the residential driveway on 39th Street, the driveway is set back
from the sidewalk and sight distance would generally be adequate for vehicles as they exit the
site.

         Site Plan Recommendation 4: Through pavement marking or other measures indicate
         that the area immediately adjacent to the exit is not part of the pedestrian zone.

Several of the parking spaces within the parking garage are adjacent to walls and a back-up area
is not provided. Vehicles may have difficulties navigating into/out of these spaces, especially
when adjacent parking stalls are occupied.
Ms. Miroo Desai
August 14, 2013
Page 18 of 26




        Site Plan Recommendation 5:           City of Emeryville Code requires that parking stalls
        adjacent to a wall be one foot wider than a standard stall. Stalls within the site are all
        generally planned to meet code required width of 8.5 feet. It is also recommended that a
        12" to 18" curb be provided to reduce the risk of vehicles scraping walls.

Parking aisle widths generally conform to the City requirement of 24 feet wide for perpendicular
parking. Most of the parking stall lengths generally conform to the City's minimum requirement
of 18 feet. However, the easternmost parking row on both the commercial and residential levels
do not appear to conform to the minimum length.

        Site Plan Recommendation 6: Modify the final parking garage design to provide at
        least 18-foot long parking stalls throughout the parking garage.

Within the commercial parking garage, there are three parking spaces adjacent to driveways that
may result in some vehicles entering the pubic right-of way in a backward direction, which
conflicts with Parking Code section (9-4-406 (c) (2) a).

        Site Plan Recommendation 7: Consider eliminating these parking stalls or convert to
        motorcycle parking only.

On the residential parking level, vehicles parked in the southeast corner could back into the
motorcycle parking area if the parking stalls are not sufficiently wide and there is not a turnabout.

        Site Plan Recommendation 8:           Consider relocating the motorcycle parking on the
        residential parking level.

Pedestrian

Pedestrian access to the residential portion of the Project would be provided from 39th Street
where residents and their guests would enter a lobby where elevator access would be provided.
A set of stairs would also provide access to the residential floors.

An entrance from West MacArthur Boulevard would also be provided that would connect to a
stairwell that provides access to the residential levels. The entrance is adjacent to a door serving
the commercial parking garage, as well as the vehicle drive aisle.

        Site Plan Recommendation 9: Bollards or other barrier should be placed between the
        driveway and the access doors on West MacArthur Boulevard.
Ms. Miroo Desai

All entrances to the commercial portion of the building area provided from the street network,
requiring patrons that drove and parked in the parking lot to exit the parking garage and walk to
the main pedestrian entrance.

           Site Plan Recommendation 10: The preferred pedestrian path from the garage to the
           surrounding street network should be indicated on the site plan, and pavement markings
           or signs should be installed in the parking garage as appropriate.

Bicycle

Short term and long term bicycle parking is required for the Project. For the commercial portion
of the Project, one short-term space is required for every 10 required vehicle parking spaces, with
a minimum of at least two bicycle parking spaces. Long-term bicycle spaces are required for
commercial uses at the same rate. This results in a requirement of two short-term and two long-
term bicycle parking spaces for the commercial portion of the Project. This likely underestimates
the bicycle parking needs as the Project applicant takes credit for reduced parking requirements
ostensibly because more patrons will use transit, walk, or bike. However, the bicycle parking
requirement is a fixed ratio of the vehicle parking supply; our approach is to establish bicycle
parking need based on the unadjusted parking supply.

It is recommended that two long-term employee spaces be provided per business entity. For the
current proposal, that would result in 8 to 10 long-term bicycle parking spaces. For patrons, it is
recommended that at least 10 to 15 short-term spaces be provided which is based on 15 to 20
percent of the unadjusted parking demand for the commercial portion of the Project. The site
plan shows 10 short term bicycle parking spaces along West MacArthur Boulevard, adjacent to
the rain garden.

           Site Plan Recommendation 11: Identify locations on the site where 8 to 10 long-term
           bicycle parking spaces and an additional five short-term bicycle parking spaces can be
           provided for the commercial uses.

For the residential portion of the Project, one short-term space is required for every four visitor
vehicle spaces and one long-term space is required for each unit. This results in a requirement of
three short-term and 105 long-term bicycle parking spaces for the residential portion of the
Project.
Ms. Miroo Desai
August 14, 2013
Page 20 of 26




Bike lockers for the residential portion of the Project are provided on the resident parking garage
level as well on each residential floor, with a total bicycle parking supply of 125 secured spaces for
the residential uses, exceeding the code requirement.         Bicycles would be permitted in the
elevator.

Transit

The proposed project is located in a transit overlay zone, as well as within a pedestrian priority
zone. The 40th Street transit mall is located approximately 800 feet from the Project site. The
Project would be subject to annual assessment to fund the operations of the Emery-Go-Round
service, which is required of all commercial entities including for-rent residential projects of more
than three units. Although the Project is expected to increase transit ridership in the area, annual
contributions will also be made to fund transit service in the area.

Delivery Vehicle Access

The City of Emeryville Code also outlines off-street loading zone requirements for a variety of
uses, as detailed in Table 9-4.409. For multi-family projects with between 50 and 149 units, one
small loading zone is required. For commercial uses, between 10,000 square feet and 20,000
square feet, one medium loading zone is required. Combined, this would result in a loading zone
requirement of two spaces. A small loading zone should be designed with a width of no less than
10 feet, a length of no less than 25 feet and a vertical clearance of no less than eight feet. A
medium loading zone should be designed with a width of no less than 12 feet, a length of no less
than 35 feet and a vertical clearance of no less than 14 feet. The Planning Director and Planning
Commission can provide discretion to modify the number and size of loading areas.

A potential on-site loading area is shown on the site plan within the commercial level of the
parking garage. Due to circulation constraints within the parking garage, this loading area would
be difficult for vehicles larger than a full size van to maneuver into and out of and would not be
able to accommodate larger delivery vehicles.

An on-street loading zone is proposed along the 39th Street frontage. This location would result
in the removal of on-street parking. It is proposed to be located adjacent to the trash service area
and would facilitate garbage service to the site. The location is also in close proximity to the
elevators serving the residential portion of the project and would facilitate residential move-
in/move-out activities. This loading zone is expected to be sufficient to accommodate move-
Ms. Miroo Desai
August 14, 2013
Page 21 of 26




in/move-out events for the residential portion of the Project as well as periodic deliveries for the
commercial establishments via single box trucks, such as UPS. For small retailers that do not have
a high volume of deliveries, the loading area on 39th Street is likely sufficient. As the site tenants
are not known, actual delivery profiles are not known and more information is needed about the
expected number of deliveries per day/week, the anticipated size of delivery vehicles and the path
of travel from the loading zone to the commercial establishments.

          Site Plan Recommendation 12: The 39th Street Loading zone should be 35 feet long to
          accommodate trucks entering and existing the loading zone. The width can be the same
          as for a parking stall. The proposed parking bay on West MacArthur Boulevard adjacent
          to the rain garden should be designed to accommodate large trucks, with a length of at
          least 50 feet dedicated to loading, with the same as for a parking stall. Should a future
          retailer require large truck deliverers on a regular basis, the parking could be restricted to
          loading during set hours. These hours would be determined considering the anticipated
          level of deliveries and would likely be a weekday from 7 AM to 11 AM. The sidewalk
          adjacent to this area should be 8 feet wide if there is no signage in the travel way, and 10
          feet if signage is proposed.

Parking

The Project proposes to provide approximately 107 off-street parking spaces plus 3 motorcycle
spaces. A credit of 1 vehicle space for every 4 motorcycle spaces is available. On-street parking is
permitted on Apgar Street and 39th Street. Parking is generally permitted on San Pablo Avenue
and Adeline Street, but not along the Project frontage. On-street parking is also permitted on
West MacArthur Boulevard in proximity to the site. Although on-street parking is permitted in
the area, available parking supplies are limited around the Project site during a typical weekday
afternoon and may not be available for site residents or patrons.

The City recently updated off-street parking requirements to reflect the expected peak parking
demands for various uses, and commercial projects are allowed the flexibility to provide 33
percent less parking than the peak demand and up to 10 percent more than the peak demand.
Residential projects are permitted to provide up to 10 percent more parking than demanded. The
Project site is also located within a transit overlay zone where all parking requirements are

reduced by 50 percent. Additionally, locally serving uses of less than 5,000 square feet are not
required to provide off-street parking and the first 1,500 square feet of each commercial uses is
exempt. A parking assessment was conducted assuming all general retail, as presented in Table
3, as well as a potential scenario with a mixture of uses.

The parking required for all general retail (Table 3) which shows parking requirements for the site
ranges between 74 and 80 for the residential uses and 16 to 26 spaces for the commercial use, for
a total parking requirement between 90 and 108 spaces for the Project assuming all retail in the
commercial space.

Should the proposed mixture of commercial uses be adjusted, or if the market area for specific
uses changes, additional parking may need to be provided for the commercial uses. For example,
with a restaurant use, retail and live work, the range of required parking for the commercial uses
increases to 20 to 33 spaces, as shown in Table 4.

The proposed parking garage layout indicates 52 vehicles spaces plus 3 vehicle spaces on the
residential parking level and 55 parking spaces on the commercial level. Although the Project as
a whole generally provides the required range of parking, insufficient parking is allocated to the
residential uses and excess parking is allocated to the commercial uses. Based on information
provided by the Project applicant, it is anticipated that parking demands of the retail patrons
would be higher than shown in Tables 3 and 4 during peak hours. It is also expected that guest
parking for the residential units would be highest in the late evening and weekends, when
commercial parking demand may be lower. Additionally, parking would be unbundled from the
rent encouraging lower rates of auto ownership within the Project site, as only tenants with cars
would pay for parking and non-car owning tenants would not subsidize the rent of car owning
tenants. The Project applicant is also coordinating with car sharing companies to provide a car
sharing pod within the Project site.

          Site Plan Recommendation 13:                    Prepare and implement transportation demand
          management and parking demand management plans for the building, potentially
          including the following strategies in addition to the strategies proposed as part of the
          Project:

          ·    Provide time limits on the commercial parking supplies not used by employees to
               encourage parking turnover for commercial patrons.

           ·   Provide information to new residents about the availability of transit in the area.
           ·   Monitor building parking demand as the commercial spaces become occupied and
               implement additional transportation demand management strategies if needed to
               manage area parking supplies.

Accessible parking spaces as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would also
need to be provided within the Project site, with the requirement based on the total number of
parking spaces. For parking areas with between 76 and 100 parking spaces, four ADA accessible
stalls are required with a least one stall designed to be van accessible. For parking areas with 101
to 150 parking spaces, five ADA accessible stalls are required with a least one stall designed to be
van accessible.

           Site Plan Recommendation 14: Four ADA spaces are shown on the current site plan. If
           the final parking supple remains between 101 and 150 spaces, an additional ADA stall is
           required.

The project would be required to equip at least three percent of the residential parking supplies
with electric vehicle charging infrastructure, resulting in two to three electric vehicle charging
stations in the residential area depending on the final residential parking supply. Three parking
stalls where electric vehicle charging stations are proposed are shown on the site plan.

This completes our transportation assessment for the proposed MAZ Project at 3800 San Pablo
Avenue. Please call Kathrin with questions or comments.

          ATTACHMENT A ­ INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
                                 ANALYSIS METHODS

The operations of roadway facilities are for vehicles described with the term "level of service"
(LOS). LOS is a qualitative description of traffic flow based on factors such as speed, travel time,
delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels of service are defined ranging from LOS A (i.e., best
operating conditions) to LOS F (worst operating conditions). LOS E corresponds to operations "at
capacity." When volumes exceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result and operations are
designated as LOS F. The City of Emeryville does not have a level of service policy for vehicles,
but strives to achieve a Quality of Service for all modes of travel.

Signalized Intersections

Traffic conditions at signalized intersections were evaluated using the method from Chapter 16 of
the Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. This operations analysis
method uses various intersection characteristics (such as traffic volumes, lane geometry, and
signal phasing) to estimate the average control delay experienced by motorists traveling through
an intersection. Control delay incorporates delay associated with deceleration, acceleration,
stopping, and moving up in the queue. Table A-1 summarizes the relationship between average
delay per vehicle and LOS for signalized intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

Traffic conditions at unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the method from Chapter 17
of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. With this method, operations are defined by the average
control delay per vehicle (measured in seconds) for each movement that must yield the right-of-
way. At two-way or side street-controlled intersections, the control delay (and LOS) is calculated
for each controlled movement, as well as the left-turn movement from the major street, and the
entire intersection. For controlled approaches composed of a single lane, the control delay is
computed as the average of all movements in that lane. The delays for the entire intersection and
for the movement or approach with the highest delay are reported. Table A-2 summarizes the
relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

RESOLUTION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF EMERYVILLE
APPROVING A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AND DESIGN REVIEW TO REUSE AN
EXISTING 25,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING FOR COMMERCIAL USES AND TO
CONSTRUCT A NEW 105-UNIT RENTAL APARTMENT BUILDING AND PARKING
STRUCTURE ON THE EXISTING SURFACE PARKING LOT TO THE EAST, ON
THE SITE OF THE "MAZ" BUILDING AT 3800 SAN PABLO AVENUE. THE
PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A TREE REMOVAL PERMIT TO REMOVE TWO
STREET TREES ON 39TH STREET. THE SITE IS PARTIALLY IN OAKLAND, AND
THE CITY OF OAKLAND HAS AGREED THAT EMERYVILLE MAY TAKE THE
LEAD ON ALL PLANNING AND BUILDING PERMITS. (APN: 12-952-24 AND 25; 49-
925-4, 6, AND 7)

WHEREAS, on July 10, 2013 Holliday Development submitted an application for a Conditional
Use Permit and Design Review to reuse an existing 25,000 square foot building for commercial
uses and to construct a new 105-unit rental apartment building and parking structure on the
existing surface parking lot to the east, on the site of the "Maz" building at 3800 San Pablo
Avenue. The project also includes a Tree Removal Permit to remove two street trees on 39th
Street (collectively, the "Project" or the "Proposal"); and

WHEREAS, the City of Emeryville Planning Commission reviewed the Proposal at a study
session on February 22, 2013; and

WHEREAS, the Planning Commission held a duly and properly noticed public hearing on
August 22, 2013 to solicit public comments and consider the Proposal; and

WHEREAS, the Planning Commission hereby determines that the project is exempt from
environmental review under State CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 that applies to in-fill
development, and also under Section 15061(b) (3), the general rule that CEQA does not apply to
projects where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in
question may have a significant effect on the environment; based on the traffic and visual
simulation studies conducted for the Project; and the staff report prepared for the proposed
Project dated August 22, 2013 (collectively, the "CEQA Documentation"); and

WHEREAS, the Planning Commission has reviewed and considered the staff report and
attachments thereto, the plans, all public comments, the CEQA documentation and the Proposal
to reuse an existing 25,000 square foot building for commercial uses and to construct a new 105-
unit rental apartment building and parking structure on the existing surface parking lot to the
east, on the site of the "Maz" building at 3800 San Pablo Avenue, subject to the conditions and
requirements set forth in Exhibit A attached to this Resolution and the applicable standards of the
Emeryville Planning Regulations ("the Record"); now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, that the Planning Commission finds that, based on the Record, that no further
environmental review under CEQA is required; and be it further
Planning Commission Resolution UPDR13-001

RESOLVED, that in approving UPDR13-001, the Planning Commission makes the following
findings required by Emeryville Municipal Code Sections 9-4.204(d)(2), 9-4.404(g)(1), 9-
4.404(g)(2), 9-7.505, and 9-7.407:

Section 1.       Conditional Use Permit Findings for Bonus Height Pursuant to Section 9-
                 4.204(d)(2):

        (a)      That the proposed Project will provide public benefits sufficient to earn the
                 number of points required for the bonus amount requested.

                 The site falls within the 55 foot height district that can be increased up to a
                 bonus height of 75 feet. The proposed height of the building reaches a
                 maximum height of 75 feet. Per Section 9-4.204(b)(1) bonus points needed for
                 the proposed height is 100 points (Bonus Amount/Bonus Increment x 100 or
                 25/25 x 100).

                 The Project provides public benefits totally 105 points through adaptive
                 reuse of a significant building (35 points); meeting the requirements of a
                 "Neighborhood Center" (35 points); and by a commitment to exceed the
                 energy efficiency requirements of the California Energy Code by 20 per cent
                 (35 points). The Project, therefore qualifies for the required 100 points.

Section 2.       Conditional Use Permit Findings for Parking Spaces Less than the Minimum
                 Pursuant to Section 9-4.404(g)(1):

        (a)      That adequate measures will be put in place to reduce parking demand such as
                 promoting use of public transit, bicycling, and walking, and allowing modified
                 working hours and telecommuting.

                 The Project's minimum off-street residential parking requirement is 61
                 resident spaces and 13 guest spaces. The guest spaces will be provided on the
                 lower level of the garage. Fifty-two off-street parking spaces for residents are
                 proposed on the upper level of the garage, leaving a deficiency of nine spaces.
                 The Project provides substantially more bicycle parking than required, in
                 bike lockers as well as on each residential floor. Further, the conditions of
                 approval require a transportation information display, a Transportation
                 Demand Management plan for the Project, and an Employee Trip Reduction
                 Program for the Project's commercial uses.

        (b)      That the reduction or elimination of the required parking spaces will not result in
                 parking impacts on adjacent uses due to overflow parking;
Planning Commission Resolution UPDR13-001
3800 San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013

                 The reduction of the required residential parking spaces will not result in
                 parking impacts on adjacent uses as the target population is a younger age
                 group that tends to favor non-auto means of transportation for physical,
                 cultural and economic reasons.

Section 2.       Conditional Use Permit Findings for Parking Spaces More than the Maximum
                 Pursuant to Section 9-4.404(g)(2):

        (a)      That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the additional parking is
                 required to meet the anticipated parking demand of the proposed uses.

                 The maximum number of commercial parking spaces allowed in the most
                 extreme scenario, with 5,000 square feet of restaurant use, is 33 spaces. The
                 project provides 55 spaces on the lower level, of which up to 13 will be
                 designated for residential guest spaces, leaving 42 spaces for commercial use.
                 This exceeds the maximum allowed by nine spaces. The applicant has had
                 experience developing other mixed use projects in urban environments that
                 shows that anticipated uses such as grocery stores and restaurant uses
                 generate more auto traffic and are more likely to be successful if adequate
                 auto parking is available. For example, the applicant built a similar project
                 at 5800 3rd Street in San Francisco that included 137 residential units above a
                 Fresh & Easy grocery (14,800 square feet) and two restaurants (roughly
                 4,800 square feet). The project was located at a Muni light rail stop and
                 included 44 parking spaces dedicated for the commercial uses that were
                 located at a separate level from residential parking. Despite its location near
                 a transit station, at peak shopping/restaurant hours parking was not
                 adequate. One restaurant went out of business because of too little parking
                 and the other threatened to leave. In this example, the applicant had to build
                 a 75-space surface parking lot adjacent to the project and provide adequate
                 signage to retain their commercial tenants. The applicant has found that co-
                 locating a grocery story type use with eating establishments creates a parking
                 demand as people tend not take transit or use bicycles while going grocery
                 shopping. Therefore, commercial parking that exceeds the City's maximum
                 is necessary.

       (b)       That the provision of additional parking will not result in an over dependence on
                 automobiles and will not adversely affect transit, bicycle or pedestrian uses.

                 Proposed parking for both commercial and residential uses occur within a
                 common two level garage so that the additional commercial parking does not
                 change the number of curb cuts needed for the project that might otherwise
                 potentially adversely impact pedestrian and bicycle access.

Section 3.       General Conditional Use Permit Findings Pursuant to Section 9-7.505:

        (a)      The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan.

                 The Land Use Diagram (Figure 2-2) classifies the project site for "Mixed Use
                 with Residential" use, which is described as (Section 2.4): "One or more of a
                 variety of residential and non-residential uses including but not limited to
                 offices, retail and hotel." The project is consistent with this description as it
                 provides multi-unit residential uses as well as a variety of commercial uses.
                 The site also falls under the "Neighborhood Retail Overlay" area in the Land
                 Use Diagram (Figure 2-2), which is described to be "intended for stores,
                 offices, services, and restaurants/cafes that serve the local community" where
                 "a majority of the ground floor use and a substantial portion of the fro ntage
                 along any public street is devoted to these uses." The project is also consistent
                 with this description.

                 General Plan goals (G) and policies (P) that are particularly germane, and
                 with which the project is consistent, include:

                 LU-G-1           An overall balance of uses ­ Employment, residential, cultural,
                                  destination and local retail ­ as well as a full range of amenities
                                  and services necessary to support a vibrant community.

                 LU- P-1          Land uses will be consistent with the Land Use Classifications in
                                  section 2.4 and the Land Use Diagram, Figure 2-2.

                 LU-P-5           Retail uses will be concentrated in areas with Neighborhood or
                                  Regional Retail overlays, near neighborhood centers, and in the
                                  Emeryville Marketplace.

                 UD-P-46          Street trees shall be provided on City streets where feasible. Street
                                  trees shall be planted in a row along the curb, between the
                                  vehicle roadway and sidewalk, unless this is physically impossible
                                  due to constraints such as underground water or sewer lines.

                 UD-P-47          Streetscape landscaping shall follow Bay-Friendly Landscaping
                                  guidelines and serve the dual purpose of treating stormwater
                                  runoff and providing shade and beauty to the urban realm.


                 UD-P-70          Street level uses should reinforce neighborhood center streets
                                  and allow a vertical mix of a diverse range of land uses including
Planning Commission Resolution UPDR13-001
3800 San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 5

                                  offices, hotels and residential uses compatible with neighborhood
                                  centers.

                 UD-P-72          Public space and plazas for gathering and expanded ground
                                  floor retail activities are encouraged. These elements enhance
                                  the pedestrian realm and provide opportunities for social
                                  interaction.

                 CSN-P-27         The City encourages developers to reuse existing historic or
                                  architecturally significant structures.

                 CSN-P-10         New development is required to incorporate source control, site
                                  design, and storm water treatment to reduce pollutants in
                                  stormwater runoff.

                 CSN-P-11         Exterior uses of water for landscaping and other purposes shall
                                  be reduced to minimize or eliminate runoff and water waste.

                 CSN-P-33         In order to reduce light pollution and use less energy, lighting
                                  (including on streets, recreational facilities, and in parking
                                  areas) should be designed to prevent artificial lighting from
                                  illuminating natural resources or adjacent residential
                                  neighborhoods.

                 CSN-P-44         The City will continue to require development projects to
                                  implement on-site stormwater management measures through
                                  the City's development permit process.

                 ST-P-5           The City shall encourage, promote, practice, and where feasible,
                                  require Bay-Friendly landscaping practices as defined in the
                                  Bay-Friendly Landscape Guidelines, Sustainable Practices for
                                  Landscape Professionals.

                 The Project has been designed to comply with these goals and policies and is
                 therefore consistent with the General Plan.

                 The General Plan designation of Neighborhood Centers, Green Streets, and
                 Pedestrian Priority Zones are implemented through the citywide Emeryville
                 Design Guidelines. To the extent feasible, the Project complies with these
                 guidelines. Where strict compliance with the guidelines has not been
                 achieved (i.e. sidewalk widths) it is because the project is a reuse of an
                 existing significant building that maintains its footprint thereby not allowing
                 widening of the sidewalk. However, the intent of the guidelines has been met.
Planning Commission Resolution UPDR13-001
3800 San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)

Page 6

                 Therefore, the Project is consistent with the General Plan provisions for
                 Neighborhood Centers, Green Streets, and Pedestrian Priority Zones.

                 The General Plan also references the San Pablo Avenue Urban Design Plan
                 to improve landscaping and streetscape design, and to guide development in
                 the San Pablo Avenue corridor. The Project is consistent with this plan and
                 its design guidelines.

        (b)      The location, size, coverage, density, design and operating characteristics of the
                 proposed use will be compatible with, and will not adversely affect, the
                 surrounding area, including neighborhood character, street design and capacity,
                 safety, noise, and lighting.

                 The location, size, coverage, density, design and operating characteristics of
                 the Project are compatible with the surrounding area as it is a mixed use
                 project that will reuse an existing building with local serving retail uses as
                 well as residential uses. A traffic report and visual simulation study were
                 done for the project that demonstrate that it will not adversely affect
                 neighborhood character or street design and capacity.

         (c)     The proposed use is consistent with the capability of the water supply, wastewater
                 disposal, fire, and police systems to operate adequately and cost effectively.

                 The project is a relatively small in-fill development and is consistent with the
                 capability of the water supply, wastewater disposal, fire, and police systems
                 to operate adequately and cost effectively.

        (d)      The proposed use at its proposed location will provide a service or facility that
                 will contribute to the general well-being of the surrounding neighborhood or
                 community.

                 The project provides a mix of commercial uses along with residential units
                 that will support the proposed as well as existing surrounding commercial
                 and residential development. Furthermore, it reuses an existing building that
                 has been mostly vacant for several years and will add to the safety and
                 livability of the surrounding community.

        (e)      The proposed use complies with all applicable standards and requirements of
                 these Planning Regulations.

                 The proposed use complies with the Planning Regulations.

Section 4.       Design Review Findings Pursuant to Section 9-7.407:

        (a)      The design of the Project is consistent with the General Plan, including but not
                 limited to its Urban Design goals and policies;

                 The design of the Project meets Urban Design Goal UD-G-2 ("A Diversity of
                 building types and scales") by reusing an existing single story significant
                 building and constructing a new five-level residential building. The Project is
                 consistent with Urban Design Policies UD-P-46 and 47 by providing six new
                 street trees and Bay-Friendly streetscape landscaping.

        (b)      The design of the Project conforms to the Emeryville Design Guidelines and any
                 other applicable design guidelines or criteria. If strict compliance with the
                 provisions of such design guidelines or criteria is not achieved, the applicant must
                 convincingly demonstrate that the intent of the guidelines is met;

                 Design Guidelines ­ General:

                 The project generally complies with the City's Design Guidelines by
                 providing the following: adequate, Bay-Friendly street landscaping
                 (Guidelines A-11 to A-15); screening loading areas (Guideline B-4), visually
                 open pedestrian entries (Guideline B-7), using permeable paving (B-9),
                 locating bicycle parking near entrances (B-10); siting buildings and plazas
                 with seating that encourage interaction between occupants and passerbys
                 (Guideline C-2); concealing mechanical equipment (Guideline C-6); a
                 variation in height and massing (Guideline D-3); a variation in roof levels
                 and use of awnings and canopies (Guideline E-6); including operable
                 windows and allowing natural ventilation (Guideline E-7), creating a well-
                 defined corner by providing a small plaza on Adeline Street and San Pablo
                 Avenue (Guideline E-10); using window design and proportions to add
                 architectural interest (Guideline F-3); devising a color palette that reinforces
                 building identity (Guideline F-13); providing clear, non-reflective glazing
                 (Guideline F-15); and providing public open spaces in form of a plaza and
                 seating within a Bay-Friendly landscaped area (Guidelines G-18, 20, and 23).

                 Design Guidelines ­ Area Specific:

                 The project site falls within the Neighborhood Retail Overlay Zone and the
                 Pedestrian Priority Overlay Zone. In addition, the Adeline Street frontage is
                 classified as a "Key Green Street" in the General Plan. Each of these
                 designations has corresponding guidelines for sidewalk dimensions. Where
                 multiple designations occur, the Design Guidelines specify that they shall be
                 prioritized as follows: (1) Neighborhood Centers, (2) Green Streets, (3)
Planning Commission Resolution UPDR13-001
3800 San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use Project ("Maz" Building)
August 22, 2013
Page 8

                 Pedestrian Priority. Thus, the Neighborhood Center guidelines would apply
                 in this case. The project complies with Guidelines I-5 and I-7 by providing
                 attractive and well landscaped entries and settings to the buildings along San
                 Pablo Avenue and designing the ground floor space with active uses such as a
                 restaurant and other retail uses that serve the local community. Guideline I-8
                 sets a 15-foot minimum sidewalk width (back of curb to building face) with a
                 3-foot building entry/public space, an 8-foot pedestrian pathway, and 4-foot
                 landscaping/street furniture zone along the curb. As the project is an
                 adaptive reuse of an existing building and retains the building footprint, it is
                 not possible to create a 15-foot minimum sidewalk width on all street
                 frontages. The San Pablo Avenue and Adeline Street frontages maintain an
                 existing configuration that includes a total of 11'9" sidewalk width with a
                 6'4" pedestrian pathway and 5'5" of landscaping. The 39th Street frontage
                 maintains an 11'10" overall sidewalk width but increases the pedestrian
                 pathway from 6'1" to 7'10" and the landscaped area from 2'7" to 4'. (See
                 Sheet A0.3). The proposed rain garden by others on the West
                 MacArthur/Apgar frontage will provide ample landscaping between the
                 sidewalk and curb. Thus, the Project generally complies with the Design
                 Guidelines for Neighborhood Centers and meets the intent of the guidelines if
                 not the exact dimensions.

        (c)      The Project is of a high design quality that is compatible with, and will not
                 adversely affect, the surrounding area;

                 This Project will result in a set of visually attractive buildings and will
                 provide an active presence along San Pablo Avenue, West Mac Arthur
                 Boulevard, and Apgar, Adeline, and 39th Streets. The proposed reuse of a
                 significant building and construction of a new, modern building are
                 compatible in scale and massing with the surrounding area.

and be it further

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION AND SOURCE CONTROL MEASURES
                   City of Emeryville, California
                           Revised 3/8/06

The numbers in Parentheses, e.g. "(I.A.)" refer to the specific measures in the "Alameda
Countywide Clean Water Program Source Control Measures Model List" approved by the
ACCWP on July 27th, 2004.

There are four sections in this document:
A.     Grading and Drainage ­ pages 1-4.
B.     Site Plan and Source Control Measures ­ pages 5-10
C.     Construction Practices ­ page 11
D.     Post-Occupancy Maintenance and Operational BMPs ­ pages 12-13

A.     Grading and Drainage

1.      All projects shall incorporate appropriate site design measures to minimize impacts to
water quality. These may include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) minimizing
impervious surfaces, especially directly connected impervious surfaces, (b) clustering buildings,
(c) preservation of quality open space, (d) maintaining and/or restoring riparian areas and
wetlands and establishing vegetated buffer areas to minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff or
minimize peak runoff. The following is a list of possible drainage systems: a vegetated roof,
supported turf or permeable pavement, dry-wells or cisterns to catch roof runoff, and/or grassy
swales. The City has adopted "Stormwater Treatment Guidelines for Green Dense
Redevelopment" and a treatment sizing worksheet, available on the City's website at:
http://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/planning/ Plans shall include stormwater pollution prevention and
control features to limit to the maximum extent practicable the entry of pollutants into
stormwater runoff, and as required by the City's current NPDES permit.

2.      Numeric Sizing Criteria for Pollutant Removal Treatment Systems:
The City of Emeryville requires that treatment BMPs be constructed for applicable projects, as
defined in section C.3.c. of the City's NPDES permit. These BMPs must incorporate, at a
minimum, the following hydraulic sizing design criteria to treat stormwater runoff. As
appropriate for each criterion, the projects shall use, or appropriately analyze, local rainfall data
to be used for that criterion.
        A. Volume Hydraulic Design Basis: Treatment BMPs whose primary mode of action
            depends on volume capacity, such as detention/retention units or infiltration
            structures, shall be designed to treat stormwater runoff equal to:
            1. The maximized stormwater quality capture volume for the area, based on
                historical rainfall records, determined using the formula and volume capture
                coefficients set forth in Urban Runoff Quality Management, WEF Manual of
                Practice No.23/ASCE Manual of Practice No. 87, (1998(, pages 175-178 (e.g.,
                approximately the 85th percentile 24-hour storm runoff event); or
            2. The volume of annual runoff required to achieve 80 percent or more capture,
                determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in Appendix D of the



       City of Emeryville Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Source Control Measures
                                        Page 1 of 13
              California Stormwater Best Management Practices Handbook, (1993), using local
              rainfall data.
       B. Flow Hydraulic Design Basis: Treatment BMPs whose primary mode of action
          depends on flow capacity, such as swales, sand filters, or wetlands, shall be sized to
          treat:
          1. 10% of the 50-year peak flow rate; or
          2. The flow runoff produced by a rain event equal to at least two times the 85th
              percentile hourly rainfall intensity for the applicable area, based on historical
              records of hourly rainfall depths; or
          3. The flow of runoff resulting from a rain event equal to at least 0.2 inches per hour
              intensity. (per the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program on 3/8/2004)

3.      The City of Emeryville adopted stormwater treatment guidelines on December 6th, 2005.
The guidelines serve as one part of the City of Emeryville's compliance with the requirements
associated with the joint NPDES permit. The City prefers vegetative design solutions such as
those described in the guidelines rather than mechanical solutions. This is because vegetative
solutions treat stormwater more effectively, involve easier maintenance and inspection, improve
air quality and provide green aesthetics. Therefore, the City desires to see vegetative solutions
whenever possible. Developers of projects subject to hydraulic sizing criteria for treatment
requirements shall be required to retain either a firm that is listed by the Bay Area Stormwater
Management Agencies Association ("BASMAA") as qualified in stormwater treatment design
(www.basmaa.org/documents, Qualified Post-Construction Consultants List), or a firm that
demonstrates similar qualifications to those on the BASMAA List, to design on-site stormwater
treatment measures. The stormwater treatment design consultant shall make a good faith effort
to meet the entire treatment requirement using vegetative solutions. If the stormwater treatment
design consultant concludes that vegetative solutions are not feasible due to site characteristics,
building uses or other legitimate reasons, and the City concurs, the City will consider allowing
on-site mechanical solutions. In some cases, upon recommendation of the stormwater treatment
design consultant, a combination of vegetative and mechanical solutions may be allowed. If
mechanical solutions are utilized, the mechanism must be approved by the City, and Developer
must demonstrate that the mechanical design will remove fine sediments and dissolved metals as
well as trash and oil. If stormwater treatment is required the applicant shall also provide, before
the Planning Commission hearing, calculations showing the percentage of on-site stormwater
treatment through mechanical means and percentage of on-site treatment through vegetative
means.

4.     The design of any stormwater quality treatment measures incorporated in the project must
incorporate the treatment control design guidance for vector control included in the Alameda
Countywide Clean Water Program's Vector Control Plan.
       Some of main issues are access:
           · Design stormwater treatment devices to be easily and safely accessible without
               the need for special requirements (e.g., OSHA requirements for "confined
               space").
           · If utilizing covers, include in the design spring-loaded or light-weight access
               hatches that can be opened easily for inspection.


       City of Emeryville Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Source Control Measures
                                        Page 2 of 13
           · Provide all-weather road access (with provisions for turning a full-size work
             vehicle) along at least one side of large above-ground structures that are less than
             25 feet wide. For structures that have shoreline-to-shoreline distances in excess of
             25 feet, a perimeter road is required for access to all sides.
       And dry system design principles that prevent mosquito breeding:
          · Structures should be designed so they do not hold standing water for more than 72
             hours.
          · Incorporate features that prevent or reduce the possibility of clogged discharge
             orifices (e.g., debris screens). The use of weep holes is not recommended due to
             rapid clogging.
          · Pipes should be designed and constructed for a rate of flow that flushes the system
             of sediment and prevents water backing up in the pipe. Storm drains should be
             constructed so that the invert out is at the same elevation as the interior bottom to
             prevent standing water.
          · Use the hydraulic grade line of the site to select a treatment system that allows
             water to flow by gravity through the structure. Pumps are not recommended
             because they are subject to failure and often require sumps that hold water.
          · Design distribution piping and containment basins with adequate slopes to drain
             fully and prevent standing water. The design slope should take into consideration
             buildup of sediment between maintenance periods. Compaction during grading
             may also be needed to avoid slumping and settling.
          · Avoid the use of loose riprap or concrete depressions that may hold standing
             water.
          · Avoid barriers, diversions, or flow spreaders that may retain standing water.
          · Use mosquito net to cover sand media filter pump sumps.
          · Use aluminum "smoke proof" covers for any vault sedimentation basins.

5.       Stormwater treatment measures that function primarily as infiltration devices (such as
infiltration basins or trenches) shall, where practical, protect groundwater from pollutants that
may be present in urban runoff. The vertical distance from the base of any infiltration device to
the seasonal high groundwater mark shall be at least ten feet (10'), and in areas characterized by
highly porous soils or high ground water tables, additional analysis may be required by the City.
Infiltration devices will not be recommended as treatment measures for areas of industrial or
light industrial activity, automotive repair shops, car washes, fleet storage areas, nurseries, and
areas subject to high vehicular traffic (25,000 or greater average daily traffic [ADT] on main
roadway or 15,000 or more ADT on any intersecting roadway). Infiltration devices shall be
located a minimum of 100 feet horizontally from any water supply well.

6.      If the project includes one or more permanent stormwater quality treatment control
measure(s), a Stormwater Treatment Measures Maintenance Agreement (Agreement) shall be
executed between the Project Owner and the City and recorded with the County Recorder's
Office of the County of Alameda. The Agreement must be executed before the Certificate of
Occupancy is issued. The property owner shall prepare, to the City's satisfaction, and submit
four required Exhibits to the Agreement: (1) a legible, recordable, reduced-scale (8.5"x11")
copy of the Site Plan indicating the treatment measure(s) location(s) and site drainage patterns;
(2) a maintenance plan, including specific long-term maintenance tasks and a schedule, and

                                        Page 3 of 13
incorporating the treatment control operation and maintenance guidance for mosquito control
from the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program's Vector Control Plan; (3) a standard
Treatment Measure Operation and Maintenance Inspection Report form (template to be provided
by the City); and (4) checklists appropriate to the type of treatment measure(s) that will be used
on the property (to be provided by the City).

7.      Vegetated areas designed to treat stormwater shall be constructed and maintained using
non-chemical practices in order to avoid discharging pollutants of concern into the City
stormdrain system. Compost, vermicastings and similar products shall be used as fertilizers
instead of NPK chemical fertilizers. Pest control practices using insecticidal soaps and bio-
degradable plant oils shall be used to control pests instead of chemical products containing, for
example, glyphosate and synthetic pyrethroids.

8.     All on-site storm drain inlets shall be stenciled or labeled ANo Dumping! Flows to Bay@
or equivalent, using methods approved by the City.                                 (I.A.)

9.      Construction access routes shall be limited to those approved by the City Engineer and
shall be shown on the approved grading plan.

10.     Prior to the commencement of any clearing, grading and/or excavation resulting in a land
disturbance of one acre or more, the applicant shall submit to the City: (a) a copy of the project's
Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and (b) evidence to the City that a Notice of
Intent (NOI) has been submitted to the (California) State Water Resources Control Board. The
SWPPP shall contain the erosion, sediment and pollution control BMPs (some of which are
described in Section C of this document) and the BMPs shall be in place before any work begins
as appropriate for that phase of construction. The plan and BMPs should be checked daily,
especially around storm events, and updated as necessary. A daily log should be kept stating that
BMPs have been checked are effective.

11.     For projects involving clearing, grading or excavation resulting in disturbance of less
than one acre of land, the applicant shall have in place erosion, sediment and pollution controls
(described in Section C of this document) to the maximum extent practicable using the current
standard BMPs as required by the City.

B.     Site Plan and Source Control Measures

The site plan shall include the following items:

1.     Pervious Surfaces:

To the maximum extent practicable projects shall limit impervious surface areas, especially
impervious areas directly connected to the storm drain system such as the historical standard
design for roof drains. Roof drains shall discharge and drain away from the building foundation
to an unpaved area wherever practicable.

2.     Refuse and Recycling Areas:                                                 (I.G.)

a      New or redevelopment projects such as food service facilities, recycling facilities and/or
multi-family residential complexes or similar facilities shall provide a roofed and enclosed area
for dumpsters and recycling containers. The area shall be designed to prevent water run-on to the
area and runoff from the area and to contain litter and trash, so that it is not dispersed by the
wind or runoff during waste removal.

b.      Runoff from food service areas, trash enclosures, recycling areas, and/or food compactor
enclosures or similar facilities shall not discharge to the storm drain system. Trash enclosure
areas shall be designed to avoid run-on to the trash enclosure area. Any drains installed in or
beneath dumpsters, compactors, and tallow bin areas serving food service facilities shall be
connected to a grease removal device and/or treatment devices prior to discharging to the
sanitary sewer. The applicant shall contact the local permitting authority and EBMUD for
specific connection and discharge requirements.

3.     Vehicle/Equipment and Commercial/Industrial Cleaning:                       (I.J.)

a.      Wastewater from vehicle and equipment washing operations shall not be discharged to
the storm drain system.

b.       Commercial/industrial facilities having vehicle/equipment cleaning needs and new
residential complexes of 25 units or greater shall either provide a roofed, bermed area for
washing activities or discourage vehicle/equipment washing by removing hose bibs (faucets) and
installing signs prohibiting such uses. Vehicle/equipment washing areas shall be paved, designed
to prevent run-on to or runoff from the area, and plumbed to drain to the sanitary sewer. A sign
shall be posted indicating the location and allowed uses in the designated wash area. The
applicant shall contact the local permitting authority and EBMUD for specific connection and
discharge requirements.

c.      Commercial car wash facilities shall be designed and operated such that no runoff from
the facility is discharged to the storm drain system. Wastewater from the facility shall discharge
to the sanitary sewer. The applicant shall contact EBMUD for specific connection and discharge
requirements.

4.     Loading Docks:                                                                (I.M.)

a.      Loading docks shall be graded to minimize run-on to and runoff from the loading area
[and/or be covered]. Roof downspouts shall be positioned to direct stormwater away from the
loading area. Stormwater runoff from loading dock areas shall be drained to the sanitary sewer,
or diverted and collected for ultimate discharge to the sanitary sewer. [Or ­ Stormwater runoff
from loading dock areas shall be connected to a post-construction stormwater treatment
measure(s) prior to discharge to the storm drain system]. The applicant shall contact the local
permitting authority [and/or sanitary district with jurisdiction] for specific connection and
discharge requirements.

b.     Door skirts between the trailers and the building shall be installed to prevent exposure of
loading activities to rain, unless one of the following conditions apply:: the loading dock is
covered, or the applicant demonstrates that rainfall will not result in an untreated discharge to the
storm drain system.

5.     Food Service Equipment Cleaning:                                              (I.F.)

a.      Food service facilities (including restaurants and grocery stores) shall have a sink or other
floor mat, container, and equipment cleaning area, which is connected to a grease interceptor
prior to discharging to the sanitary sewer system. The cleaning area shall be large enough to
clean the largest mat or piece of equipment to be cleaned. The cleaning area shall be indoors or
in a roofed area outdoors; both areas must be plumbed to the sanitary sewer. Outdoor cleaning
areas shall be designed to prevent stormwater run-on from entering the sanitary sewer and to
prevent stormwater run-off from carrying pollutants to the storm drain. Signs shall be posted
indicating that all food service equipment washing activities shall be conducted in this area. The
applicant shall contact EBMUD for specific connection and discharge requirements.

6.     Outdoor Process Activities/Equipment:                                         (I.H.)

(Examples of businesses that may have outdoor process activities and equipment include
machine shops and auto repair shops, and industries that have pretreatment facilities.)

a.     Process activities shall be performed either indoors or in roofed outdoor areas. If
performed outdoors, the area shall be designed to prevent run-on to and runoff from the area with
process activities.

b.     Process equipment areas shall drain to the sanitary sewer system. The applicant shall
contact EBMUD for specific connection and discharge requirements.

7.     Fuel Dispensing Areas:                                                        (I.L.)

a.      Fueling areas shall have impermeable surfaces (i.e., Portland cement concrete or
equivalent smooth impervious surface) that are: a) graded at the minimum slope necessary to
prevent ponding; and b) separated from the rest of the site by a grade break that prevents run-on
of stormwater to the maximum extent practicable.

                                        Page 6 of 13
b.      Fueling areas shall be covered by a canopy that extends a minimum of ten feet in each
direction from each pump. Alternative: The fueling area must be roofed and the roof's minimum
dimensions must be equal to or greater than the area within the grade break or fuel dispensing
area which is defined as the area extending a minimum of 6.5 feet from the corner of each fuel
dispenser or the length at which the hose and nozzle assembly may be operated plus a minimum
of one foot, whichever is greater. The canopy or roof shall not drain onto the fueling area.

8.     Pesticide/Fertilizer Application:                                             (I.D.)

a.       Landscaping shall be designed to minimize irrigation and runoff, promote surface
infiltration where appropriate, and minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides that can
contribute to stormwater pollution. Landscape designs should utilize Integrated Pesticide
Management practices such as those detailed in the "Bay Friendly Landscaping Guidelines"
available at www.StopWaste.Org.

b.     Structures shall be designed to discourage the occurrence and entry of pests into
buildings, thus minimizing the need for pesticides. For example, dumpster areas should be
located away from occupied buildings, and building foundation vents shall be covered with
screens.

c.     If a landscaping plan is required as part of a development project application, the plan
shall meet the following conditions related to reduction of pesticide use on the project site:

       1. Where feasible, landscaping shall be designed and operated to treat stormwater runoff
          by incorporating elements that collect, detain, and infiltrate runoff. In areas that
          provide detention of water, plants that are tolerant of saturated soil conditions and
          prolonged exposure to water shall be specified.

       2. Plant materials selected shall be appropriate to site specific characteristics such as soil
          type, topography, climate, amount and timing of sunlight, prevailing winds, rainfall,
          air movement, patterns of land use, ecological consistency and plant interactions to
          ensure successful establishment.

       3. Existing native trees, shrubs, and ground cover shall be retained and incorporated into
          the landscape plan to the maximum extent practicable.

       4. Proper maintenance of landscaping, with minimal pesticide use, shall be the
          responsibility of the property owner.

       5. Integrated pest management (IPM) principles and techniques shall be encouraged as
          part of the landscaping design. Examples of IPM principles and techniques include:

               a.     Select plants that are well adapted to soil conditions at the site.
               b.     Select plants that are well adapted to sun and shade conditions at the site.

                       Consider future conditions when plants reach maturity. Consider seasonal
                       changes and time of day.
               c.      Provide irrigation appropriate to the water requirements of the selected
                       plants.
               d.      Select pest- and disease-resistant plants.

4.     Stabilize all cut and fill slopes as soon as possible after grading is completed.

5.    Ensure that concrete, gunite and plaster supply trucks and operations do not discharge
wash water into street gutters or drains.

6.     Create and use a contained, covered area on the site for storing bags of cement, paints,
flammables, oils, fertilizers, pesticides and any other materials used on the project site that could
be discharged to the storm drain system by wind or a spill.

7.    Place tarps on the ground to collect fallen debris or splatters that could contribute to
stormwater pollution.

8.    Gather all construction debris daily and place it in a container which is emptied or
removed weekly.

9.      Never clean machinery, tools, brushes, etc. or rinse containers into a street, gutter, storm
drain or stream.

10.    For projects with on-site storm drain inlets, clean all inlets immediately prior to the rainy
season (October 1), and as required by the City Engineer.

11.    Install straw wattles, berms, check dams as appropriate to contain and/or filter stormwater
and the sediments from the site.

12.   Hydroseed or cover exposed soil with tarps, loose straw or mats to reduce erosion and
sediment suspension in stormwater.

13.     Check all on-site machinery and vehicles for oil, fuel and other machine fluid leaks on a
daily basis and fix machinery or capture all leaked fluids.

D.     Post-Occupancy Maintenance and Operational BMPs

For projects installing post-construction stormwater treatment systems, as required by provision
C.3 of the City NPDES permit, a Stormwater Treatment Measures Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) Agreement must be signed by the property owner before the issuance of the building
permit (see A.6 above in this document.)

The following section describes Operational best management practices (BMPs) that rely on
private property owners to implement following construction of projects.

For commercial and industrial projects and residential projects with ten units or more, before the
City issues the Certificate of Occupancy, the applicant must submit evidence of a lease
agreement, purchase and sale agreement, or a set of covenants, conditions and restrictions
(CC&Rs) that includes the following practices and specifies who will perform them and who will
monitor the performance.

1.     Paved Sidewalks and Parking Lots:                                           (II.A.)

Sidewalks and parking lots shall be swept regularly to minimize the accumulation of litter and
debris. Debris resulting from pressure washing shall be trapped and collected to prevent entry
into the storm drain system. Washwater containing any soap, cleaning agent or degreaser shall
not be discharged to the storm drain and shall be collected and discharged to the sanitary sewer
The applicant shall contact the local permitting authority and EBMUD for specific connection
and discharge requirements.

2.     Private Streets, Utilities and Common Areas:                                (II.B.)

street sweeping of paved private roads and cleaning of all storm drain inlets.

b.      For residential developments, where other maintenance mechanisms are not applicable or
otherwise in place a property owners association, architectural committee, maintenance
assessment district, special assessment district, or similar arrangement shall be created and shall
be responsible for maintaining all private streets and private utilities and other privately owned
common areas and facilities on the site including landscaping. These maintenance
responsibilities shall include implementing and maintaining stormwater BMPs associated with
improvements and landscaping and will include the maintenance responsibilities described in the
maintenance plan, which is included as an attachment to the stormwater treatment measure O&M
agreement for the subject property. CC&Rs creating the association shall be reviewed and
approved by the City Attorney prior to the recordation of the Final Map and recorded prior to the
sale of the first residential unit. The CC&Rs or special assessment district shall describe how the
stormwater BMPs associated with privately owned improvements and landscaping shall be
maintained by the association or the special assessment district.
