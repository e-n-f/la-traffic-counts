Fehr & Peers/Kaku Associates evaluated the potential traffic impacts and pedestrian circulation
needs of the proposed Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Central Region MacArthur
Park Elementary School Addition (project) in the City of Los Angeles. The project site is bounded
by West 7th Street to the north, South Grand View Street to the east, West 8th Street to the south,
and South Park View Street to the West. This study is designed to be an integral element of an
environmental impact report (EIR) being prepared to evaluate the overall effects of this project. It
includes a description of the assumptions and methods used to conduct the study as well as a
discussion of the results.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The project site, located at 2300 West 7th Street in the City of Los Angeles, will be developed
partially on the existing MacArthur Park Primary Center campus and partially on adjacent land that
will be acquired. Approximately 35,000 square feet (sf) of new space will be added to the existing
15,000 sf, for a total of 50,000 sf. Classrooms, a multi-purpose building, library, food services
building with a lunch shelter, playfield, and an underground parking structure will be built. The
multi-purpose building will be one story in height and will be built above the one-story
underground parking garage. Minor changes to the existing campus will be made.


The expanded school will serve kindergarten through fifth grades, and is scheduled to open in the
third quarter of 2012. The school will be on a two semester calendar and will be open during
normal business hours (8 am to 5 pm), with potential evening civic center uses. The existing
MacArthur Park Primary Center is supported by 25 full and part-time staff members.            Upon
completion, the new school will be supported by 50 full and part-time staff members. The project
will add 400 new seats to the existing 250-seat campus, for a total of 650 seats. The project will
add 16 new classrooms to the existing 10 classrooms, for a total of 26 classrooms. The existing
surface level parking lot will be demolished and relocated to an underground structure that will
provide 59 total spaces, resulting in 25 net new spaces. The entrance to the parking structure will



                                                 1
be located off of South Grand View Street. A 60-foot bus drop-off zone will also be developed on
Grand View Street. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the project in relation to the surrounding
street system and Figure 2 illustrates the general site layout and driveway locations.




STUDY SCOPE


The scope of analysis for this study was developed in consultation with staffs of both the Los
Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) and LAUSD. The base assumptions, technical
methodologies, and study area were identified as part of the study approach. The traffic impact
study to evaluate the potential for impacts caused by the project includes an analysis of the
following traffic scenarios:

    ·    Existing Conditions ­ The analysis of existing traffic conditions is intended to provide a
         basis for the study. The existing conditions analysis includes an assessment of streets,
         traffic volumes and operating conditions.

    ·    Future Base (2012) Conditions ­ Future traffic conditions are projected for the year 2012
         without the proposed project. The year 2012 is the projected year that the proposed
         elementary school is anticipated to open. The objective of this analysis is to forecast the
         future traffic growth and intersection operating conditions expected to result from general
         regional growth and specific related projects developed in the vicinity of the project site by
         the year 2012. This scenario is used as the baseline against which potential project traffic
         impacts are evaluated.

   ·     Future (2012) plus Project ­ This is an analysis of future traffic conditions with traffic
         expected to be generated by the proposed project added to the year 2012 future base
         traffic forecasts. The incremental impacts of the proposed project on future traffic
         operating conditions can then be identified.


The study area for this analysis includes the following intersections on the perimeter of the site:


    1.   South Park View Street and West 7th Street
    2.   South Park View Street and West 8th Street
    3.   South Grand View Street and West 7th Street
    4.   South Grand View Street and West 8th Street


The intersections to be analyzed, illustrated in Figure 1, were determined by LADOT staff as
part of the development of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the project. This
report conforms to the assumptions agreed to in the MOU and is in accordance with the



                                                   2
June 24, 2005 Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between LADOT and LAUSD. Use of trip
generation rates, methodologies, and other standards in the MOC document provides for
consistency of traffic studies for LAUSD new school projects throughout the City.   In accordance
with the MOC, traffic impacts were evaluated in the study for the a.m. peak hour.


Per LADOT's request, a traffic signal warrant and a pedestrian crossing warrant analyses were
conducted for the intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street.




ORGANIZATION OF REPORT


This report is divided into seven chapters, including this introduction. Chapter II presents an
analysis of the existing street system and traffic conditions for each of the intersections in the
study area.   Forecasts of future traffic including project-generated traffic are presented in
Chapter III. Potential impacts of the project on the study intersections are discussed in Chapter
IV.   Chapter V provides traffic signal warrant analysis and a pedestrian crossing warrant
analysis.   Chapter VI includes a Congestion Management Program analysis.              Finally, a
summary of the analyses and study conclusions makes up Chapter VII. Appendices to this report
include details of the technical analysis and supporting calculation worksheets.

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of
existing conditions in the study area. The assessment of conditions relevant to this study includes
land use, an inventory of the local street system, traffic volumes on these facilities, and operating
conditions at key intersections.




STREETS AND HIGHWAYS


The study area for this analysis is bounded by West 7th Street to the north, South Grand View
Street to the east, West 8th Street to the south, and South Park View Street to the west. Primary
regional access to the area is provided by the Harbor Freeway (I-110), which runs in a north-
south direction approximately one mile east of the project site, the Hollywood Freeway (US-
101), which runs in a northwest-southeast direction approximately one-and-one-quarter mile
north of the project site, and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), which runs in an east-west
direction approximately one-and-one-half-miles south of the project site. Primary local access is
provided by West 7th Street, West 8th Street, South Park View Street, and South Grand View
Street. The following describes the key streets serving the project site:


   ·   West 7th Street ­ West 7th Street, which runs in the east-west direction adjacent to and
       north of the project site, is classified as a secondary arterial. Four through lanes and one
       left-turn lane are provided. On-street parking is restricted for the segment adjacent to the
       project site. One-hour metered parking is available east of the project site. The posted
       speed limit is 35 miles per hour (mph).

   ·   West 8th Street ­ West 8th Street, which runs in the east-west direction south of the
       project site, is classified as a secondary arterial. Four through lanes and two left-turn
       lanes are provided at the intersection with South Park View Street. Four through lanes
       with shared left-turns are provided at the intersection with South Grand View Street. On-
       street one-hour metered parking is available in select areas, except during peak traffic
       hours. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.

   ·   South Park View Street ­ South Park View Street, which runs in the north-south direction
       adjacent to and west of the project site, is classified as a local roadway. On-street one-
       hour metered parking is generally available along the east curb and part of the west


                                                 6
       curb. The exceptions for the east curb are a street cleaning restriction on Fridays from
       12 p.m. to 3 p.m., and 15-minute parking 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on school days for the
       segment of the curb adjacent to the school. The exception for the west curb is a street
       cleaning restriction on Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.

   ·   South Grand View Street ­ South Grand View Street, which runs in the north-south
       direction adjacent to and east of the project site, is classified as a local roadway. On-
       street one-hour metered parking is available on the east curb except for a street cleaning
       restriction on Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. 15-minute parking is available on the
       west curb from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on school days, except for a street cleaning restriction
       on Fridays from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. A 50-foot segment of the west curb directly in front of
       the school's main entrance is reserved for school bus pick-up and drop-off from 7 a.m. to
       5 p.m. on school days.

Diagrams of the existing lane configurations at the analyzed intersections are shown in
Appendix D1.




EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE


The following sections present the existing peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections, a
description of the methodology used to analyze the intersection traffic conditions, and the resulting
level of service (LOS) at each of the study intersections under existing conditions.




Existing Traffic Volumes


Weekday morning peak hour traffic counts were conducted at the four analyzed intersections on
April 15, 2008 when the existing MacArthur Park Primary Center was in session.             Figure 3
illustrates the existing turning movement traffic volumes. Appendix D2 contains the detailed traffic
count data.




Level of Service Methodology


LOS is a qualitative measure used to describe the condition of traffic flow, ranging from
excellent conditions at LOS A to overloaded conditions at LOS F. LOS D is typically considered
to be the minimum acceptable LOS in urban areas. One of the four analyzed intersections in this

LEVEL OF VOLUME/CAPACITY
SERVICE     RATIO (V/C)                               DEFINITION


    A             < 0.600         EXCELLENT. No vehicle waits longer than one red
                                     light, and no approach phase is fully used.

                                    VERY GOOD. An occasional approach phase is
    B         > 0.600 < 0.700      fully utilized; many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                                            restricted within groups of vehicles.

                                     GOOD. Occasionally drivers may have to wait
    C         > 0.700 < 0.800        through more than one red light; backups may
                                            develop behind turning vehicles.


                                   FAIR. Delays may be substantial during portions
    D         > 0.800 < 0.900     of the rush hours, but enough lower volume periods
                                       occur to permit clearing of developing lines,
                                             preventing excessive backups.


                                   POOR. Represents the most vehicles intersection
    E         > 0.900 < 1.000      approaches can accommodate; may be long lines
                                    of waiting vehicles through several signal cycles.


                                    FAILURE. Backups from nearby locations or on
                                   cross streets may restrict or prevent movement of
    F             > 1.000             vehicles out of the intersection approaches.
                                    Tremendous delays with continuously increasing
                                                     queue lengths.

study (Park View Street and 8th Street) is traffic signal controlled.       Table 1 provides LOS
definitions for signalized intersections.


LADOT requires that the Critical Movement Analysis (CMA) method (Transportation Research
Circular No. 212, Interim Materials on Highway Capacity, Transportation Research Board, 1980)
of intersection capacity analysis be used to determine the intersection volume-to-capacity (V/C)
ratio and corresponding LOS for the given turning movements and intersection characteristics at
signalized intersections.


The signalized intersection in this study is controlled by the City of Los Angeles' Automated Traffic
Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system. This system allows for real time surveillance and
adjustments at the intersection level to increase intersection capacity.      Per standard LADOT
procedures, a capacity increase of 7% (0.07 V/C ratio adjustment) was applied to reflect the
benefits of ATSAC.


Three of the four study intersections are not signalized. These intersections were analyzed
using the CMA method. Based on direction from LADOT, to reflect the reduced capacity of an
unsignalized intersection, the total intersection capacity was reduced from 1,500 vehicles per
lane per hour (common for a two-phase signalized intersection) to 1,200 vehicles per lane per
hour.




Existing Peak Hour Levels of Service


The existing weekday morning peak hour turning movements presented in Figure 3 were used in
conjunction with the LOS methodologies described above to determine existing operating
conditions at each study intersection. LOS calculation worksheets are included in Appendix D3.
Table 2 summarizes the a.m. peak hour V/C ratios and corresponding LOS at each study
intersection.   The results of this analysis indicate all four study intersections are currently
operating at LOS A during the morning peak hour.

                              III. FUTURE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS




In order to evaluate properly the potential impact of the project on the local street system, it was
necessary to develop estimates of future traffic conditions in the area both with and without the
project. Future traffic volumes were first estimated for the study area without the project. These
future forecasts reflect traffic increases due to general regional growth and traffic expected to be
generated by other future developments in the vicinity of the project and represent future base
conditions. Project traffic was added to the future base to represent future plus project conditions.




FUTURE BASE TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The future base traffic projections reflect anticipated future traffic increases that can be expected
from two sources. The first is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects general increases in
traffic due to regional growth and development. The second source is traffic generated by specific
future projects located within, or in the vicinity of, the study area. The methods and assumptions
used to develop the future base traffic projections are described below.




Areawide Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase between the year 2008 and the year 2012 as a result of
general areawide and regional growth and development. LADOT has determined that an ambient
growth factor of 1% per year should be used to adjust the existing year 2008 traffic volumes to
reflect the effects of regional growth and development in the project vicinity by the year 2012.




Related Projects Trip Generation and Assignment

The second factor used in the development of the future base traffic forecasts is the effect of
specific known projects in the vicinity of the project. Information on proposed or recently approved



                                                 12
developments within a two-mile radius of the study intersections were obtained from LADOT. A
review of these lists indicated that 88 projects have been proposed or approved in the study area.
These projects are described in Table 3 and their locations are illustrated in Figure 4.


Trip Generation. Projected weekday a.m. peak hour trip generation for the related projects was
provided by LADOT. In/out split data from Trip Generation, 7th Edition (Institute of Transportation
Engineers, 2003) was used to split the total peak hour trips obtained from LADOT for each project
into inbound and outbound trips. As indicated in Table 3, the 88 related projects are expected to
generate a combined total of approximately 11,195 trips during the weekday a.m. peak hour.


Trip Distribution and Assignment. Traffic expected to be generated by the related projects was
assigned to the street network using the trip generation estimates and trip distribution patterns
dependent on the type and density of the proposed land use, the geographic distribution of
population from which the employees and potential patrons of the proposed commercial projects
could be drawn, the geographic distribution of employment and activity centers to which residents
of the proposed residential projects could be attracted, and the location of the projects in relation
to the surrounding street system. These related project-only traffic volumes were added to the
existing traffic volumes, after the adjustment for areawide growth, to represent future base
conditions (i.e., future conditions without the proposed project). Figure 5 illustrates the future
base traffic volumes for 2012.




PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Development of future traffic forecasts for the project used a three-step process similar to the
process described for the related projects. The process estimated the project's trip generation,
trip distribution, and traffic assignment.




Project Trip Generation


Trip generation estimates for the proposed project were prepared following the rates provided in
the June 24, 2005 MOC between LADOT and LAUSD. The rates are based on empirical data
of existing schools in LAUSD's jurisdiction, and relate the number of trips generated by school

proposed project would provide 650 total seats for grades Kindergarten through 5, an increase of
400 seats over the existing 250-seat school on the campus. The trip generation rates for a
Central Region elementary school, as specified in the MOC, were applied to the increased
number of students. The resulting trip estimates are 136 a.m. peak trips, or 76 inbound and 60
outbound trips.


A trip generation credit was taken for the existing land uses to be acquired and removed as part of
the project. Application of the trip generation rates, as specified in Trip Generation, 7th Edition,
Institute of Transportation Engineers 2003, indicates that the elimination of a 30,000 sf medical
office building would result in a trip reduction of 74 a.m. peak trips, or 48 inbound and 26
outbound trips during the a.m. peak hour.


To be conservative, no credit was taken for the artist studio building given the low level of current
activity. Per LAUSD, current activities include two small offices, occasional off-peak and weekend
art showings, and occasional filming.


As indicated in Table 4, the project is estimated to generate a net increase of approximately 62
trips (28 inbound, 34 outbound) during the a.m. peak hour.




Project Trip Distribution


The geographic distribution of project-generated traffic is based on the density and the
geographical dispersion of the population for the school's area of influence. The attendance area
for the school would be generally south of Wilshire Boulevard, west of Alvarado Street, north of
Olympic Boulevard, and east of Hoover Street. Based on this information, the following trip
distribution pattern was developed and is illustrated in Figure 6:


           ·      North ­ 15%
           ·      East ­ 15%
           ·      South ­ 35%

Project Trip Assignment


The project trip generation estimates summarized in Table 4 and the distribution pattern
illustrated in Figure 6 were used to assign the project-generated traffic to the local and regional
street system and through the four study intersections. Figure 7 illustrates the assignment of
estimated project-generated peak hour traffic volumes at each of the study intersections during
typical weekday peak hours.




FUTURE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The project-generated traffic volumes in Figure 7 were then added to the future base traffic
volumes, resulting in the future plus project traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 8. These volumes
represent projected future weekday peak hour traffic conditions following the completion of the
project.

                                IV. TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS




This section presents an analysis of the potential impacts of the project on the local street system.
The analysis compares the projected LOS at each study intersection with the project in 2012 to
the future base (no project) scenario to determine potential project impacts, as defined by
significant impact criteria established by the City of Los Angeles.




INTERSECTION SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA


The City of Los Angeles has established threshold criteria that determine whether a project has a
significant traffic impact at a specific intersection. Under the City's guidelines, a project impact
would be considered significant if the following conditions are met:


                Intersection Conditions
                   with Project Traffic                 Project-related Increase
               LOS           V/C Ratio                        in V/C Ratio
                 C         > 0.700 ­ 0.800            Equal to or greater than 0.040
                 D         > 0.800 ­ 0.900            Equal to or greater than 0.020
               E, F            > 0.900                Equal to or greater than 0.010




FUTURE BASE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS


The results of the analysis of the four study intersections under future base traffic conditions are
summarized in Table 5. Background traffic growth and traffic generated by related projects is
expected to cause a minor decline in operating conditions from the existing conditions for all
study intersections, even without consideration of potential traffic associated with the project.
Table 5 indicates, however, that all four intersections are projected to continue to operate at LOS
A.

Notes:
[a] Intersection is stop-controlled. Stop-controlled intersection analysis was performed using the CMA methodology
    and a reduced capacity of 1,200 vehicles per hour per lane.
 * Intersection is currently operating under ATSAC system.
FUTURE PLUS PROJECT TRAFFIC ANALYSIS


The future plus project peak hour traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 8 were analyzed to
determine the projected year 2012 future operating conditions with the completion of the project.
Application of the significance criteria established by the City of Los Angeles indicates that the
project would not create significant traffic impacts at any of the four analyzed intersections.




PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES


The traffic impact analysis above determined that development of the project is not expected to
cause significant impacts at any of the four study intersections.           Therefore, no mitigation
measures are required.

           V. TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT AND PEDESTRIAN WARRANT ANALYSIS




This chapter presents an analysis of the traffic signal warrant and pedestrian warrant analysis
conducted for the intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street, as requested by
LADOT.




TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS


The traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted in accordance with the standards in the Manual
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for Streets and Highways (United States Department
of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration, 2003). Operations at the unsignalized
intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street would not be substantially improved
by signalization. The projected future plus project traffic volumes at the intersection would not
satisfy the Eight Hour Vehicle Volume warrant (MUTCD Warrants 1, 1A, 1B, 1C), the Four Hour
Vehicle Volume warrant (MUTCD Warrant 2), or the Peak Hour Vehicle Volume warrant (MUTCD
warrant 3). The signal warrant analysis worksheet is shown in Appendix D4.




PEDESTRIAN WARRANT ANALYSIS (SCHOOL CROSSING)


The pedestrian school crossing warrant analysis was conducted in accordance with the standards
in MUTCD Section 4C.06 Warrant 5, School Crossing, which states:


       "The School Crossing signal warrant is intended for application where the fact that
       school children cross the major street is the principal reason to consider installing a
       traffic control signal. The need for a traffic control signal shall be considered when an
       engineering study of the frequency and adequacy of gaps in the vehicular stream as
       related to the number and size of groups of school children at an established school
       crossing across the major street shows that the number of adequate gaps in the traffic
       stream during the period when the children are using the crossing is less than the
       number of minutes in the same period and there are a minimum of 20 students during
       the highest crossing hour."




                                               27
Traffic gap counts were conducted and pedestrians were observed crossing the west leg of the
intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street during both the morning peak
pedestrian period encompassing the existing school opening time and the afternoon period
encompassing the school closing time on a regularly scheduled school day. The counts for the
morning peak school arrival period between 7:40 a.m. and 8:20 a.m. showed 50 adequate
crossing gaps in the traffic stream. The counts for the afternoon peak school departure period
between 2:15 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. showed 66 adequate gaps in the traffic stream. The number of
adequate gaps in the traffic stream exceeds the number of minutes during the peak crossing
times. Therefore, the School Crossing Pedestrian Warrant 5 is not satisfied and installation of a
traffic control signal is not warranted.


A school crossing warrant analysis was also conducted in accordance with the Manual of
Policies and Procedures Section 353 (LADOT, October 2005). This method tests for installation
of flashing yellow beacons and a school area traffic signal based on the vehicle volume and the
number of school-aged pedestrians crossing the street for the two highest hours. The school-
aged pedestrian volumes are projected by factoring the existing volumes with a factor of 2.6
(650-seats over 250-seats), consistent with the proportional increase in the number of students
at the school.


The Flashing Yellow Beacons section requires three parts to be satisfied:

        Part A: The vehicle volume and the number of school-aged pedestrians crossing the
                street for the two highest hours must exceed 200 and 40, respectively, for
                urban areas, and 140 and 40, respectively, for rural areas.

        Part B:   The critical approach speed of the major street must exceed 35 mph.

        Part C:   The nearest controlled crossing must be more than 600 feet away.

The School Area Traffic Signal section requires two parts to be satisfied:

        Part A:   The vehicle volume and the number of school-aged pedestrians crossing the
                  street for the two highest hours must exceed 500 and 100, respectively, for
                  urban areas, and 350 and 70, respectively, for rural areas. In this section, a
                  daily pedestrian volume can be substituted instead of the two highest hours
                  with the requirement that the daily volume exceeds 500 for urban areas and
                  350 for rural areas.

        Part B:   The nearest controlled crossing must be more than 600 feet away.



                                                28
The Flashing Yellow Beacons section satisfied both Part A and Part B; however, Part C was not
satisfied. The nearest controlled crossing is located at South Park View Street and West 7th
Street (west intersection) approximately 460 feet west of the South Grand View Street and West
7th Street study intersection.


The School Area Traffic Signal section satisfied Part A; however, Part B was not satisfied.
Similar to the previous section, the nearest controlled crossing is located approximately 460 feet
west of the analyzed intersection. As a result, the Flashing Yellow Beacons and the School
Area Traffic Signal warrants are not met.


The traffic signal warrant and pedestrian warrant analysis worksheets are shown in Appendix D4.




RECOMMENDED PEDESTRIAN ROUTES


The study area was surveyed to determine the locations of existing traffic controls that could be
used by students to access the proposed school site from adjacent neighborhoods.            Traffic
controls adjacent to the site include school crossing signs, marked crosswalks, sidewalks, and
signalized and stop-controlled intersections. Figure 9 is an illustration of the LADOT Pedestrian
Routes for the existing school. It should be noted that the intersection of South Grand View Street
and West 7th Street has a 15 foot wide yellow "zebra" crosswalk across the west leg.

                 VI. REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS




Regional transportation system impact analysis was conducted in accordance with the
requirements in 2004 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (CMP) (Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, July 2004). The Transportation Impact
Analysis (TIA) section in the CMP describes the threshold criteria used to identify potential CMP
monitoring locations that should be included in the traffic analysis. Based on the CMP criteria, the
following locations must be analyzed:


    ·   Mainline freeway monitoring locations where a project will add 150 or more trips, in
        either direction, during either a.m. or p.m. weekday peak hours.

    ·   All CMP arterial monitoring intersections, including freeway on- and off-ramp intersections,
        where a proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the a.m. or p.m. weekday
        peak hours (of adjacent street traffic).

In addition, potential impacts on the regional transit system must be evaluated.




CMP FREEWAY ANALYSIS


The mainline freeway monitoring location nearest to the project site is the I-110 east of South
Grand View Street. According to the peak hour project trip generation, the project would generate
62 new trips during the a.m. peak hour, far less than the 150 trip analysis threshold, and many of
these trips are not expected to be on the freeway system. Therefore, no further CMP freeway
analysis is required and project impacts on the regional freeway system are considered to be
insignificant.




CMP ARTERIAL INTERSECTION ANALYSIS


The nearest CMP arterial monitoring location is at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and
Alvarado Boulevard.    This CMP intersection is approximately one-half-mile northeast of the


                                                31
study intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street. As shown in the project trip
generation estimates in Table 4 and the project a.m. peak hour distribution in Figure 6,
approximately 62 a.m. peak hour trips are projected project-related trips. Since the nearest CMP
intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Boulevard is approximately one-half-mile
northeast of West 7th Street, allowing project-related traffic to disperse, and Alvarado Boulevard
is a boundary for the attendance area of the proposed project, it is estimated that fewer than 50
weekday peak hour trips would travel through the CMP intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and
Alvarado Boulevard. Therefore, no further CMP intersection analysis is required and the project
impact at this location would be insignificant.




REGIONAL TRANSIT IMPACT ANALYSIS


Section D.8.4 of the CMP provides a methodology for estimating the number of transit trips
expected to result from a proposed project based on the projected number of vehicle trips. This
methodology assumes an average vehicle ridership (AVR) factor of 1.4 in order to estimate the
number of person trips to and from the project and then provides guidance regarding the
percent of person trips assigned to public transit depending on the type of use and proximity to
transit service. The nearest designated transit center is the Westlake/MacArthur Park Metro
Red Line Station. Since the project site is located inside the one-quarter mile boundary from
this station and commercial land uses are prevalent in this path, the CMP guidelines estimate
that approximately 15% of the project person trips may use public transit to travel to and from
the site.


This is a general application according to CMP guidelines. It should be noted that this project
site has an educational land use classification that draws its students from the nearby
neighborhood as shown by the dashed service area boundary in Figure 1. As a result, it can be
assumed that only staff trips generated by the school can be applied to transit trips.


Upon project completion, the new school will be supported by 50 full and part-time staff
members.     Assuming the 15% transit mode split suggested in the CMP, this results in
approximately eight new transit person trips in the morning peak hour. Based on the analysis of
the existing operating schedule for the Metro Red Line, it is estimated that there are a total of 24
trains stopping at the Westlake/MacArthur Station during the a.m. peak hour. Based on the



                                                  32
analysis of the Metro bus lines serving the surrounding project site area (Metro Bus Lines 26,
51, 66, 352), it is estimated that there are a total of 30 bus stops during the a.m. peak hour.
This results in the conclusion that the project would add, on an average, about one person trip
per every three trains, or one person trip per every three buses.     At this minimal level of
absorption, it is concluded that project-related impacts to the regional transit system are
insignificant.

                              VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS




This report documents the assumptions, methodologies, and findings of a study conducted by
Fehr & Peers/Kaku Associates to evaluate the potential traffic and circulation impacts of the
proposed Central Region MacArthur Park Elementary School Addition. The following summarizes
the findings of the study:


    ·   A total of four intersections were analyzed in the study area for potential traffic impacts.
        All four intersections are currently operating at acceptable LOS A.

    ·   The proposed Central Region MacArthur Park Elementary School Addition includes
        approximately 35,000 sf of new space to be added to the existing 15,000 sf of the
        MacArthur Park Primary School campus, for a total of 50,000 sf. The project will provide
        400 new seats and 16 new classrooms to the existing 250 seat and 10 classroom facility,
        for a total of 650 seats and 26 classrooms for Kindergarten through fifth grade students.
        The existing surface level parking lot will be replaced with an underground structure
        providing 59 total spaces (25 net new).

    ·   Analysis of the year 2012 future base conditions, representing future conditions without
        the project, indicates that all four intersections would operate at LOS A.

    ·   Analysis of the future plus project conditions indicates that, using the City of Los Angeles
        criteria for determining significance of impact, the project would not create any significant
        impacts on the four analyzed intersections.

    ·   Traffic signal and pedestrian crossing warrant analyses were conducted for the
        unsignalized intersection of South Grand View Street and West 7th Street. Vehicular
        volume requirements were not met for MUTCD Warrants 1-3. The existing number of
        gaps adequate for pedestrian crossing was sufficient according to MUTCD School
        Crossing Warrant 5, meaning that the warrant is not satisfied. The LADOT Manual of
        Policies and Procedures' School Crossing Warrant 5 was not met since a signalized
        intersection is located less than 600 feet away from the analyzed intersection.

    ·   Analysis of potential impacts on the regional transportation system conducted in
        accordance with CMP requirements determined that the project would not have a
        significant impact on the regional freeway system.
