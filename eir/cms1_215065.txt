This study presents the traffic impact analysis for the proposed improvements to the John
Anson Ford Theatres (Project) located in the County of Los Angeles near the Hollywood
community of the City of Los Angeles (City). The methodology and base assumptions used in
the analysis were established in conjunction with the County of Los Angeles Department of
Public Works (LACDPW) and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT).




PROJECT LOCATION


The Ford Theatres are located at 2580 Cahuenga Boulevard East, east of the 101 freeway
between Cahuenga Terrace and Lakeridge Road approximately six miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles (the Project Site). The Project Site comprises an approximately 32-acre
County of Los Angeles regional park. Access to the Project Site is currently provided via four
driveways along the east side Cahuenga Boulevard East.


The area surrounding the Project Site includes a mix of residential uses and open space. The
uses north, south and east of the Project Site are separated from the developed areas of the
Project Site by open spaces areas and the steep topography formed by the canyon setting. The
Hollywood Bowl is also located southwest of the Project Site, across Cahuenga Boulevard East,
Cahuenga Boulevard West and the US 101 (Hollywood Freeway). It should be noted that the
Hollywood Bowl comprises approximately 70 acres and includes an Amphitheatre with a seating
capacity of approximately 17,376, four surface parking lots and a valet parking area, 15 picnic
areas, concession services, box offices, a museum, and other visitor shops and amenities.




                                                                                              1
EXISTING SITE CONDITIONS


The Ford Theatres, some of the oldest performing arts venues in Los Angeles, are owned by
the County of Los Angeles and operated through a three-way partnership between the County
of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation, the County of Los Angeles Arts
Commission, and The Ford Theatre Foundation. The Project Site currently contains the existing
Ford Theatres facility, which includes an approximately 1,200-seatAmphitheatre1 with related
support spaces and ancillary facilities including projection booth and control rooms, concession
building, box office, plaza and picnic areas, production offices and backstage facilities for
performers, an indoor venue ([Inside] The Ford) with approximately 87 seats located below the
Amphitheatre seating, and a former motel building with approximately 10,500 square feet (sf)
that is currently used as office space for the Arts Commission, Department of Parks and
Recreation, and Ford Theatre Foundation (approximately 20 employees), as well as Los
Angeles Philharmonic (approximately 140 employees). The Project Site also includes a cell
tower and associated structures, as well as other facility support spaces such as storage and
maintenance areas and restrooms located throughout. The remaining portions of the Project
Site are comprised of surface parking areas and undeveloped open space. The Project Site
also includes non-designated user-created hiking trails in the hills behind the Amphitheatre and
around a cross that is not part of the Project Site.


During performances, the Project Site currently provides parking for approximately 350-380
vehicles in a stacked parking configuration. Surface parking areas comprised of both asphalt
and dirt areas are located along Cahuenga Boulevard East (the north parking lot and the south
parking lot), as well as adjacent to the secondary entrance at the Amphitheatre level. During
events, parking is also available at the Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station, where
a shuttle is provided to and from the Project.                   The stacked parking configuration is very
inefficient from both a patron experience and operational standpoint. For example, patrons
must wait for vehicles parked in front of them to move in order to exit the parking areas. A
detailed description of the observed pre-event loading and parking operations is provided in
Appendix A. The Hollywood Bowl also uses the existing parking facilities during non-event days
or during low attendance events at the Ford Theatres.

  It should be noted that after commencement of this traffic study and collection of traffic counts, the old seats within
the Amphitheatre were replaced, which resulted in the loss of four seats. Therefore, the Amphitheatre currently
contains 1,196 seats. The 1,196-seat Amphitheatre will be maintained as part of the Project.




                                                                                                                       2
As mentioned, access to the Project Site is provided via four driveways along the east side of
Cahuenga Boulevard East. The driveway at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge
provides primary access to the Project Site. During events, this driveway is used for patrons
entering by passenger vehicle and for shuttle access from the Universal City/Studio City Metro
Red Line Station. During non-event times, this driveway serves as the main ingress and egress
point for employees and vendors. The northernmost driveway, located north of the intersection
of Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, is primarily used for egress after events and
is occasionally used for overflow stacked parking. The two southern driveways, located south of
the intersection of Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, are primarily used for egress
from the southern surface parking lot after events.


The internal roadway that leads from Pilgrimage Bridge to the secondary entrance at the
Amphitheatre level serves as the performer entrance to the lower level Amphitheatre support
spaces, as well as providing access for shuttle and vehicular loading and unloading, trash
pickup, media truck parking, and fire truck staging.


Pedestrian access to the Project Site is available from several locations along Cahuenga
Boulevard East, including via the four existing driveways, as well as a walkway located in front
of the former motel building. Within the Project Site, pedestrian access to the Amphitheatre is
available from the main entrance located at the bottom of Edison Plaza, adjacent to the box
office, and from the secondary entrance located at the Amphitheatre level.


The Ford Theatres currently hosts an average of approximately 184 events throughout the year,
including 84 events within the Amphitheatre from May through October and approximately 100
events within the [Inside] The Ford theatre from November through April.        An average of
approximately 50,640 people attend events within the Amphitheatre during the May through
October event season and approximately 4,000 people attend events within the [Inside] The
Ford theatre throughout the November through April event season, for a total annual attendance
of approximately 54,640 people. During the event seasons, the hours of operation are 8:00 AM
to 11:00 PM, daily.




                                                                                               3
APPROVED AMPHITHEATRE IMPROVEMENTS


In September 2013, the County of Los Angeles prepared a Notice of Exemption pursuant to
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, Article 19, Section 15331, Historical
Resource Restoration/Rehabilitation (Class 31) for the rehabilitation of portions of the existing
Amphitheatre. The improvements will provide for hillside stabilization, stage reconstruction,
disabled access and code compliance improvements, theatrical systems infrastructure
improvements, and mechanical and electrical systems upgrades.            Implementation of these
improvements will address long-deferred maintenance and needed repairs, mitigation of water
infiltration, provision of slope stabilization, and provide enhanced theatrical infrastructure and
performer amenities.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The Project is proposed to enhance existing facilities and provide for new artistic programming
opportunities that together would stimulate the Project Site and transform the existing Ford
Theatres from a single-use performing arts facility to a multi-use cultural and recreational center.
The Project includes the rehabilitation of portions of the existing Amphitheatre and the
development of new buildings and outdoor plaza areas. These improvements, which would be
developed in several phases as funding permits, include a 299- seat theatre, a multi-purpose
flex space, a restaurant, office spaces, and enhanced parking facilities and visitor amenities.
The Project also provides for the renovation of exterior landscape areas and enhanced vehicle
and pedestrian circulation. An approximately three-quarter mile hiking trail located between two
trailheads along the north and south ends of the Project Site is also proposed. Further, a new
Transit Center will be constructed to accommodate shuttle and valet loading and unloading.


The Project is comprised of the following components:


   ï·   Amphitheatre Rehabilitation Improvements-includes rehabilitation of portions of the
       existing Amphitheatre
   ï·   The Ford Terrace, which includes office space and lower-level concessions area and a
       raised plaza deck above a service level




                                                                                                   4
   ï·   The Ford Plaza, which is set atop a new parking structure and would feature a
       restaurant, a 299-seat theatre, a new box office, a conference room, and offices and
       visitor amenities
   ï·   The Transit Center, which would include a designated area for bus and valet drop-off, a
       new parking structure, and a multi-purpose flex space (Flex Space) that could
       accommodate approximately 99 seats
   ï·   A three-quarter mile hiking trail, approximately four feet in width, with trail terminations at
       the north and south parking structures within the Transit Center and Ford Plaza,
       respectively


In total, the Project will have three Theatres/spaces; with an increase of 311 theatre seats over
existing conditions. The Project includes 13,660 sf of additional office space for a total of
24,160 sf, and a 5,400 sf quality restaurant.      The Project also includes other support and
ancillary facilities, such as box offices, museum/gallery for The Ford Theatres, shops, visitor
amenities, projection booth and control room, outdoor areas, backstage spaces, etc. Parking
will primarily be provided in two new parking garages, Parking Structure 1 (south) and Parking
Structure 2 (north) that provide approximately 500 parking spaces in a self-park configuration.


Figure 1 shows the site plan of the proposed Project.


Access to the Project Site would continue to be available via the four existing driveways along
the east side of Cahuenga Boulevard East with some configuration and circulation
modifications.   To facilitate access and circulation within the Transit Center, the Project
proposes to add a fifth driveway on Cahuenga Boulevard East just north of the Pilgrimage
Bridge that will serve as an exit-only driveway for the Transit Center. The proposed driveway
would provide right-turn-only egress from the Transit Center and the parking structure.


The driveway at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, which currently provides
primary access to the Project Site, would be maintained in its existing location and
configuration. The northernmost driveway, which is currently used primarily for egress after
events, would be reconfigured internally to provide direct access to the proposed maintenance
facility and allow egress from Parking Structure 2. The southern driveways would be maintained
in their existing locations with the southernmost driveway providing ingress to the south Parking
Structure 1 and the other driveway providing egress. Ingress and egress to the south parking
structure would also be provided from the main entrance.




                                                                                                     5
Within the Project Site, pedestrian access to the Amphitheatre would continue to be provided at
the main entrance. In addition, new pedestrian pathways would be provided for access to the
new areas. The secondary entrance at the Amphitheatre level would be modified to form the
Service Court, which would provide a loading dock and stage loading area to serve events and
general facility maintenance such as trash and recycling pickup as well as fire department
access. The Project would also include bicycle amenities.


Project operations would include theatre programming that consists of cultural, entertainment,
and educational programs. . Overall, implementation of the Project would result in approximately
47,550 net new sf of new facilities and approximately 48,750 net new sf of outdoor plaza areas
within the Project Site. It is estimated that with the new event spaces as part of the Project, the
number of annual events may increase to approximately 331 events and the number of annual
attendees may increase to approximately 93,725 people. A summary of events and attendance
is provided in Appendix A. The hours of operation at The Ford Theatres would continue to be
from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily. It is anticipated that existing Los Angeles County Parks and
Recreation, County Arts Commission and Ford Theatre Foundation staffing within the Project
Site would increase by 85 employees.        The approximately 140 Los Angeles Philharmonic
employees currently housed on site will be relocated and will no longer be accommodated
within the office portion of the Project. However, it is envisioned that other Arts Commission
employees (or other County-related staff/employees) may be relocated to the Project Site as
part of the Project in place of the Los Angeles Philharmonic employees that will be removed.
The number of employees that may be relocated to the site would not exceed the existing
number of employees on site (i.e., 140 Los Angeles Philharmonic employees).


As a Project design feature, the start times of simultaneous events to be held in the
Amphitheatre and 299-seat theatre on weekday evenings (e.g., after 6:00 PM) will be staggered
by a minimum of 45 minutes in order to separate the arrival patterns of each theatreâs patrons.
This condition has been reflected in the traffic analysis of weekday evening conditions included
in this study. The Project also includes preparation and implementation of a Parking and Traffic
Management Plan (PTMP) to minimize the effect of parking and traffic on the surrounding street
system. The PTMP includes measures such as defining travel routes, as well as operational
and scheduling measures, to further reduce and manage parking and traffic at The Ford
Theatres for both event days and non-event days.      The PTMP is further described in Chapter 9
of this traffic impact report.



                                                                                                  6
The Project would be implemented in several phases as funding becomes available and may be
completed as early as 2020.

                                          Traffic Impact Analysis Methodology


This chapter describes the various traffic scenarios analyzed, the methodologies used for
assessing intersection and street segment operating conditions, and significant traffic impact
criteria for the jurisdictions overseeing the analysis.




TRAFFIC ANALYSIS SCENARIOS


Attendance levels for The Ford Theatres programs can vary depending on the time of the year
and the nature of the program/event. For example, programs may range from a small meeting
to an event that utilizes both the Amphitheatre and smaller Theatres. To evaluate the worst
case scenario of operations, this traffic study analysis represents an event that utilizes the
maximum seating capacity of the Theatres. Weekday and Saturday âpre-eventâ peak hour
conditions were analyzed, as they represent the time periods preceding a large evening
program in the Theatres (e.g., sold-out large concert, etc.)          The traffic analysis includes
weekday AM and PM commuter peak hour conditions, as well as weekday evening and
weekend midday and evening event conditions.




STUDY SCOPE AND ANALYSIS CONDITIONS


The Project is in the County of Los Angeles, which requires that traffic studies follow the criteria
contained in LACDPWâs Traffic Impact Analysis Report Guidelines (Jan 1, 1997). However, since
all of the study intersections are in within City of Los Angeles jurisdiction, based on direction from
LACDPW staff, this traffic study follows LADOTâs Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (May
2012), which establishes the guidelines for determining the appropriate traffic analysis for a
project, analysis methodologies, significance thresholds, etc. As required by Traffic Study Policies
and Procedures, the traffic analysis focused on weekday and weekend peak hours (i.e., the time




                                                                                                     9
periods in which congestion is at its greatest levels), which generally corresponds to the highest
hour on a weekday during the morning and afternoon commuter periods and the midday peak
hour on a weekend. In addition, as previously noted, analysis of the weekday and weekend
evening âpre-eventâ peak hour was also prepared. The scope of analysis for this study was
developed in consultation with LACDPW and LADOT staff. The base assumptions and technical
methodologies (i.e., trip generation, study locations, analysis methodology, etc.) were identified as
part of the study approach and were reviewed and approved by LACDPW staff.


The traffic impact study evaluates the potential for impacts caused by the Project on the street
system surrounding the Project site. Consistent with Traffic Study Policies and Procedures, the
following analysis conditions are analyzed for the Project:


   ï·   Existing Conditions â The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a basis for the
       assessment of existing plus project and future traffic conditions. The Existing Conditions
       analysis includes a description of key area streets and highways, traffic volumes, and
       operating conditions at the time the Notice of Preparation (NOP) was issued.

       To identify the weekday morning and afternoon commuter peak hours, the weekend
       midday peak hour, as well as the weekday and weekend âpre-eventâ peak hours for
       each intersection, intersection turning movement counts for typical weekday morning
       (7:00 AM to 10:00 AM), weekday afternoon (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) and weekday evening
       (6:00 PM to 9:00 PM), Saturday midday (11:00 AM to 1:00 PM), and Saturday evening
       (6:00 PM to 9:00 PM) peak periods were collected in September 2013 when The Ford
       Theatres and Hollywood Bowl amphitheatres were both holding events. Fieldwork (lane
       configurations, signal phasing, parking restrictions, etc.) for the analyzed intersections
       was collected in late 2013.

   ï·   Existing Plus Project Conditions â CEQA, LACDPW and LADOT require an evaluation of
       project traffic impacts on the existing environment as part of traffic impact analyses.
       This analysis evaluates the potential project-related traffic impacts as compared to
       existing conditions.

   ï·   Future Without Project Conditions (2020) â This analysis projects the future traffic
       growth and intersection operating conditions that could be expected as a result of
       regional growth and related projects in the vicinity of the Project Site by year 2020. The
       Future without Project traffic conditions are projected by adding ambient traffic growth
       (compound 1% per year) and traffic from related projects to existing conditions. This
       analysis provides the conditions by which project impacts are evaluated at full buildout.

   ï·   Future Plus Project Conditions (2020) â This analysis identifies the potential incremental
       impacts of the project at full buildout, prior to mitigation, on projected future traffic
       operating conditions by adding the net project-generated traffic to the Future without
       Project traffic forecasts (year 2020).




                                                                                                   10
INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODOLOGY


Signalized Intersections


Intersections under the jurisdiction of the City were evaluated using the Critical Movement
Analysis (CMA) methodology, which determines volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios on a critical
movement basis. The overall intersection V/C ratio is subsequently assigned a level of service
(LOS) value to describe intersection operations.      The CMA methodology was implemented
using LADOTâs Calcadb Lite spreadsheet application to analyze intersection operating
conditions. LOS is a qualitative measure used to describe traffic flow conditions. Table 1
presents a description of the LOS categories, which range from excellent, nearly free-flow traffic
at LOS A to stop-and-go conditions at LOS F.


The Cityâs Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) and Adaptive Traffic Control
System (ATCS) control all of the signalized study intersections. In accordance with standard
LADOT procedures, a capacity increase of 10% (0.10 V/C adjustment) was applied to reflect the
benefits of ATSAC and ATCS control at these intersections, as further described in the following
paragraphs.


The ATSAC)system represents an advanced system in computer control of traffic signals. It
was first put into operation in June 1984 in the Coliseum area of the City of Los Angeles to
anticipate the expected increase in traffic due to the Summer Olympic Games, and has since
been expanded to other parts of the City. The advantages of ATSAC-controlled traffic signals
are substantial, including real-time adjustment of signal timing plans to reflect changing traffic
conditions, identification of unusual traffic conditions caused by incidents, the ability to
implement special purpose short-term signal timing changes in response to incidents, and the
ability to identify signal equipment malfunctions quickly. LADOT estimates that implementation
of this system improves intersection capacity by an average of 7%.


ATCS is a computer-based traffic signal control program that provides fully responsive traffic
signal control based on real-time traffic conditions. It automatically adjusts and optimizes traffic
signal timing in response to current traffic demands on the entire signal network such that the
number of stops and the amount of delay is minimized along with improved traffic signal
coordination throughout the network.      LADOT estimates that implementation of this system



                                                                                                  11
improves intersection capacity by an additional 3% over those operating under the ATSAC
system alone.




Unsignalized Intersections


Unsignalized intersections were analyzed using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) stop-
controlled methodology and HCM unsignalized methodology.             These methods quantify the
intersection operations in terms of average vehicular delay in seconds.            Consistent with
LADOTâs traffic study guidelines, it was determined that unsignalized intersections would be
assessed for signalization according to the following criteria:

   1. Is the intersection projected to operate at LOS E or F during the analyzed peak hours
      with Project implementation?

   2. Does the Project add traffic to the intersection?

   3. If Nos. 1 and 2 are met, then the intersection should be evaluated for installation of a
      traffic signal.

The determination that an unsignalized intersection meets the criteria of a traffic signal warrant
does not in itself require the installation of a signal. Rather, the decision on whether a traffic
signal should be installed is made by the governing jurisdictions taking into consideration other
factors such as distance to adjacent signalized intersections and interruption to traffic flow along
the major street.




IMPACT CRITERIA AND SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS


The significance of the potential impacts of Project generated traffic at each study intersection
was determined using criteria identified in Traffic Study Policies and Procedures (City criteria)
and Traffic Impact Analysis Report Guidelines (County criteria).


Both the City and the Countyâs Sliding Scale Method for calculating the level of impact due to
traffic generated by a proposed project, a significant transportation impact is determined based
on the criteria presented below:




                                                                                                  12
                              Intersection Significance Thresholds
                        Intersection Conditions        Project-Related Increase
                           with Project Traffic         in V/C Ratio Equal To
                          LOS           V/C Ratio          or Greater Than
                           C          0.701 - 0.800              0.04
                           D          0.801 - 0.900              0.02
                         E or F          > 0.900                 0.01


The relative impact of the added traffic volumes to be generated by the Project was evaluated
based on analysis of operating conditions at the study intersections, with and without the
Project. Using these criteria, for example, a project would not have a significant impact at an
intersection if it is operating at LOS C after the addition of project traffic and the incremental
change in the V/C ratio is less than 0.040. If the intersection, however, is operating at LOS F
after the addition of project traffic and the incremental change in the V/C ratio is 0.010 or
greater, the project would be considered to have a significant impact.              A project is not
considered to have a significant impact if the intersection is projected to operate at LOS A or B
after the addition of project traffic, regardless of the volume of traffic added to the intersection or
the incremental change in the V/C ratio. In general, according to the significant impact criteria,
the higher the V/C ratio, the lower the amount of project traffic that can be added before causing
a significant impact.


As required by Traffic Study Policies and Procedures, the Projectâs impacts were evaluated
against the Existing and Future (2020) traffic conditions. The following discussion details the
capacity analysis procedures utilized to evaluate the V/C relationships and LOS characteristics
at each study intersection.




CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ANALYSIS


The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a State-mandated program that serves as the
monitoring and analytical basis for transportation funding decisions in the County made through
the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) and State Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP) processes. The CMP requires that a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) be performed
for all CMP arterial monitoring intersections where a project would add 50 or more trips during
either the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours and all mainline freeway monitoring locations




                                                                                                     13
An analysis of operating conditions at all CMP arterial and freeway monitoring stations that may
be impacted by the Project was performed, as detailed in Chapter 10, in accordance with the
TIA guidelines referenced in 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County
(Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority [Metro], 2010).




ADDITIONAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS


In addition to the various intersection analysis scenarios and the CMP analysis discussed above,
this study includes a review of various other features and conditions related to the proposed
Project. These include a review of Project access and circulation and an analysis of potential
traffic impacts associated with the Projectâs construction.        An analysis of the unsignalized
intersections and a detailed analysis of facilities under the jurisdiction of the California Department
of Transportation (Caltrans) are provided in the appendices.




                                                                                                     14

                                        VERY GOOD. An occasional approach phase is fully utilized;
                                        many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted within groups of
       B             0.601 - 0.700      vehicles.
                                        GOOD. Occasionally drivers may have to wait through more
                                        than one red light; backups may develop behind turning
       C             0.701 - 0.800      vehicles.


                                        FAIR. Delays may be substantial during portions of the rush
                                        hours, but enough lower volume periods occur to permit
       D             0.801 - 0.900      clearing of developing lines, preventing excessive backups.

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of
existing conditions in the Project Study Area. The existing conditions analysis relevant to this
study includes an assessment of the existing street system, an analysis of traffic volumes and
current operating conditions, and an analysis of the existing public transit service.




STUDY AREA


The Study Area includes a geographic area approximately two miles (north-south) by
approximately one-half mile (east-west). This Study Area was established in consultation with
LACDPW and LADOT and by reviewing the existing intersection/corridor operations, Project peak
hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of Project vehicular trips, and the potential
impacts of Project traffic.


A traffic analysis study area generally comprises those locations with the greatest potential to
experience significant traffic impacts due to the Project as defined by the lead agency. In the
traffic engineering practice, a study area generally includes those intersections that are:


    1. Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site
    2. In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected future
       adverse operational issues
    3. In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
       percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
       intersections)

The Project Study Area was designed to ensure that all potentially significantly impacted
intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed, and the boundary of the Study Area was
extended, as necessary, to confirm that there were no significant impacts at or outside the
boundary of the Study Area.



                                                                                                      16
A total of eight intersections in the Study Area were identified during the scoping process for
detailed analysis of the above conditions. Figure 2 illustrates the location of the Site in relation to
the surrounding street system and the analyzed intersections. The intersections selected for
evaluation are:


       1.        Cahuenga Boulevard West & Barham Boulevard
       2.        Cahuenga Boulevard East & Barham Boulevard
       3.        Cahuenga Boulevard West & Pilgrimage Bridge (unsignalized)
       4.        Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge
       5.        Highland Avenue/Cahuenga Boulevard West & Hollywood Bowl Road/US-101
                 Southbound On-Ramp
       6.        US-101 Northbound Off-Ramp & North Cahuenga Boulevard
       7.        Highland Avenue & Odin Avenue
       8.        North Cahuenga Boulevard & Odin Avenue




EXISTING STREET SYSTEM


The existing street system in the Study Area consists of a regional roadway system including
freeways, arterials and collector and local streets. The secondary arterials, collectors, and
selected local streets in the Study Area offer sub-regional and local access and circulation
opportunities.    These transportation facilities generally provide two to six travel lanes and
usually allow parking on either side of the street. Typically, the speed limits range between 25
and 40 miles per hour (mph) on the principal and secondary arterials, collector, and local
streets.


Street classifications are designated in the City of Los Angeles Transportation Element of the
General Plan (âGeneral Planâ) (Los Angeles Department of City Planning, 1999). The available
facilities in the Study Area are defined by the following:


   ï·   Freeways are high-volume/high-speed roadways with limited access provided by
       interchanges that carry regional traffic through and do not provide local access to
       adjacent land uses.




                                                                                                     17
   ï·    Arterial Streets are major streets that serve through traffic, as well as provide access to
        major commercial activity centers. Arterials are divided into three categories: Major
        Class Highway I, Major Class Highway II, and Secondary Highway.
           o   Major Highway Class I has an average daily traffic (ADT) of more than 50,000.
           o   Major Highway Class II is typically located one mile apart in a grid system, with
               an ADT of 30,000 to 50,000.
           o   Secondary Highway supplements the through-traffic characteristics of major
               highways and typically located one mile apart midway between major highways,
               with an ADT of 20,000 to 30,000.

   ï·    Collector Streets are intended to assist local traffic flow to major and secondary
        highways and should be located at no greater than one-quarter mile intervals between
        major or secondary highways in a grid system, if practical, with an ADT of up to 10,000.

   ï·    Local Streets provide circulation for local adjacent neighborhoods and do not typically
        serve commercial uses. Local streets provide connections to collector streets, which in
        turn, connect to the greater street network.


Primary regional access to the Project Site is provided by US-101. The major arterials providing
regional and sub-regional access to the Project vicinity include Cahuenga Boulevard East and
Cahuenga Boulevard West. The following is a brief description of the major streets in the Study

        from Thousand Oaks to downtown Los Angeles in the morning and from downtown Los
        Angeles to Thousand Oaks in the evening through US Route 101.



BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN NETWORK


Existing Bicycle System


Based on 2010 Bicycle Plan, A Component of the City of Los Angeles Transportation Element,
(Los Angeles Department of City Planning, adopted March 1, 2011), the existing bicycle system
in the Study Area consists of a limited coverage of bicycle lanes (Class II) and bicycle routes
(Class III). Bicycle lanes are a component of street design with dedicated striping, separating
vehicular traffic from bicycle traffic. These facilities offer a safer environment for both cyclists
and motorists.    Bicycle routes are identified as bicycle-friendly streets where motorists and
cyclists share the roadway and there is no dedicated striping of a bicycle lane. Bicycle routes
are preferably located on collector and lower volume arterial streets.




                                                                                                    20
Within the Study Area, bicycle lanes are provided on North Cahuenga Boulevard between Odin
Avenue and Yucca Street. There are two streets designated as bicycle routes: Odin Avenue
between Highland Avenue and North Cahuenga Boulevard and Wilcox Avenue south of North
Cahuenga Boulevard.




Existing Pedestrian Facilities


The sidewalks that serve as routes to the Project Site are limited and do not provide proper
connectivity and adequate widths for a comfortable and safe pedestrian environment throughout
the Project vicinity. Sidewalks are provided along the east side of Cahuenga Boulevard East
along the Project Siteâs property frontage; however, they terminate to the north of the site.
Extending south from the Project Site, a narrow sidewalk/parkway area is provided along the
east side of Cahuenga Boulevard East that provides connectivity to the neighborhoods to the
south. The sidewalks provide limited connectivity to pedestrian crossings at intersections within
the Study Area.


Generally, the signalized intersections in the area provide marked pedestrian crossings and
include, the study signalized intersections provide pedestrian phasing, crosswalk striping, and
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) wheelchair ramps.


It should be noted that the signalized intersection located immediately adjacent to the Project Site
(Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge) does not currently provide marked crosswalks
across Cahuenga Boulevard East (north and south legs of the intersection) or Pilgrimage Bridge.
Therefore, pedestrian connectivity to the Project Site via Pilgrimage Bridge to and from areas west
of Cahuenga Boulevard East is deficient.




EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE


This section presents the existing peak hour turning movement traffic volumes for the
intersections analyzed in the study, describes the methodology used to assess the traffic
conditions at each intersection, and analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each
intersection indicating V/C ratios and LOS.



                                                                                                  21
Existing Traffic Volumes


In order to cover both the peak hours of adjacent street traffic and the event peak hours
intersection turning movement counts were conducted at the eight study area intersections
during the typical weekday morning commuter peak period (7:00 AM to 10:00 AM), weekday
afternoon commuter/evening peak period (5:00 PM to 9:00 PM), Saturday midday peak (11:00
AM to 1:00 PM), and Saturday evening peak (6:00 PM to 9:00 PM) in September 2013 when
both The Ford Theatres and Hollywood Bowl were holding events.            The existing weekday,
weekday event, and Saturday intersection traffic volumes are illustrated in Figures 5A, 5B, and
5C, respectively.   The summary data worksheets of turning movement counts at the study
intersections are provided in Appendix B.


The traffic volumes illustrated in Figures 5A, 5B, and 5C were analyzed using the CMA
methodology described above to determine the existing operating conditions at the analyzed
intersections. The calculation is expressed in a V/C ratio for critical movements where the
volumes at the intersection are compared to the capacity of the intersection.




Existing Intersection Levels of Service


Table 3 summarizes the existing weekday morning, weekday afternoon, weekday event,
Saturday midday event, and Saturday evening event peak hour V/C ratio and the corresponding
LOS for each of the analyzed intersections.


As summarized in Table 3, the following intersections are operating at LOS E or LOS F during
at least one of the five peak study periods:
   ï·   Int. 1: Cahuenga Boulevard West & Barham Boulevard (LOS E â Weekday
       AM/Weekday Event)
   ï·   Int. 2: Cahuenga Boulevard East & Barham Boulevard (LOS F â Weekday AM, LOS E â
       Weekday Event)
   ï·   Int. 5: Highland Avenue & Hollywood Bowl Road/US-101 Southbound On-Ramp (LOS E
       â Weekday AM/Weekday PM/Weekday Event)

The LOS calculation worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

Estimates of future cumulative traffic conditions both with and without the Project were developed
to evaluate the potential impacts of the Project on the local street system. This discussion details
the assumptions used to develop the Future 2020 conditions without the Project.


In order to develop the Future without Project traffic conditions (Year 2020), the existing traffic
volumes were factored upward by a compounded 1% annual ambient growth rate to
approximate future traffic volumes. In addition to this ambient growth, background and other
related projects/cumulative development traffic were also added to estimate the Future without
Project (2020) traffic conditions.




CEQA GUIDELINES REGARDING FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS


The forecast of Future without Project conditions was prepared in accordance with procedures
outlined in Section 15130 of Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality
Act, Chapter 3, Title 14, California Code of Regulations (California Natural Resources Agency,
amended July 27, 2007)(CEQA Guidelines). Specifically, CEQA Guidelines provides two options
for developing the cumulative traffic volume forecast:


       â(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
       cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
       the [lead] agency, or

       (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted general plan or related
       planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted
       or certified, which described or evaluated regional or area wide conditions
       contributing to the cumulative impact. Any such planning document shall be
       referenced and made available to the public at a location specified by the lead
       agency.â




                                                                                                  31
Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of Future without Project
traffic volumes as it incorporates both the âAâ and âBâ options outlined in the CEQA Guidelines for
purposes of developing the forecast.




FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The existing plus ambient growth traffic volumes were combined with the related project
volumes to form the Future without Project (2020) conditions. This scenario forms the basis of
the evaluation of Project impacts in the Future plus Project (2020) conditions.




Ambient Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase as a result of regional growth and development. Based
on historical trends and the City of Los Angeles guidelines and procedures, an ambient growth
factor of 1% per year compounding was used to adjust the existing traffic volumes to reflect the
effects of regional growth and development by the year 2020.




Related Projects


In accordance with requirements in CEQA Guidelines, this study considered the effects of the
Project in relation to other developments either proposed, approved, or under construction in the
Study Area. These development proposals (called related projects) are projected to be
implemented in the Project vicinity prior to the buildout date of the Project. With this information,
the potential impact of the proposed Project can be evaluated within the context of the cumulative
impact of all ongoing development.


The list of related projects is based on information provided by the Department of City Planning
and LADOT. The related projects,which are generally located within a one and one-half mile
radius of the Project site, are detailed in Table 4. The locations of these related projects are
shown in Figure 6, while Figures 7A, 7B, and 7C depict the traffic volumes associated with these




                                                                                                   32
related projects at the study intersections for weekdays, weekday events, and Saturdays,
respectively.


It should be noted that other projects were considered during the development of the list of related
projects to be included as part of the traffic analysis. Other considered projects included the
Paramount Studios Master Plan and the NBC Universal Evolution Plan, which have anticipated
buildout years of 2038 and 2030, respectively.         Thus, substantial construction will not be
completed by the 2020 buildout year of the Project. Other projects such as small expansions, re-
use, and small residential projects that are not anticipated to generate a significant amount of
traffic that would affect the study intersections were considered, although not listed.      These
projects are accounted for in the application of the ambient growth rate described above.


The development of estimated traffic volumes added to the Study Area as a result of related
projects involves the use of a three-step process: trip generation, trip distribution, and traffic
assignment.


Trip Generation. Trip generation estimates for the related projects were provided by LADOT
and were calculated using a combination of previous study findings and the trip generation rates
contained in Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2012). The
forecast related projects trip generation is shown in Table 4. These projections are conservative
in that they do not in every case account for either the existing uses to be removed or the likely
use of other travel modes (transit, walk, etc.) In order to include related project traffic in the
background of all study scenarios, it was assumed the weekday PM peak hour trip generation
also occurs during the weekday event peak hour and that the Saturday midday peak hour trip
generation also occurs during the Saturday event peak hour.


Trip Distribution. The geographic distribution of the traffic generated by the related projects is
dependent on several factors. These factors include the type and density of the proposed land
uses, the geographic distribution of population from which the employees/residents and potential
patrons of the proposed developments are drawn, and the location of these projects in relation to
the surrounding street system. These factors are considered along with logical travel routes
through the street system to develop a reasonable pattern of trip distribution.




                                                                                                  33
Traffic Assignment. The trip generation estimates for the related projects were assigned to the
local street system using the trip distribution pattern described above. These volumes were then
added to the existing traffic volumes after adjustment for ambient growth through the projected
buildout year of 2020. These volumes represent the Future without Project conditions (i.e.,
existing traffic volumes, ambient traffic growth, and related project traffic). The resulting Future
without Project peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C for weekdays,
weekday events, and Saturdays, respectively.


Future Roadway Improvements. Based on discussions with the City, there are no future
roadway improvements (either programmed improvements or other mitigation for other recently
approved developments) in the Study Area that are anticipated to be fully funded and constructed
prior to the buildout of the Project (i.e., 2020). Although future improvements are being planned
for the area (e.g., Barham Bridge improvement project, freeway ramp improvements), no future
roadway improvements were included as part of the future conditions analyses, so as to provide a
conservative analysis.


Future Bicycle System. The future bicycle system in the Study Area will be expanded to create
a more integrated network, as proposed in the 2010 Bicycle Plan. The three components of the
bicycle network include the Backbone, the Neighborhood Network and the Green Network. Class
II bicycle lanes will be added to high volume corridors to from the Backbone of the network, while
in-road bikeways in lower volume and collector streets will form the Neighborhood Network
through the implementation of Class III bicycle routes and bicycle-friendly streets. The Green
Network consists of dedicated bike paths that connect the Cityâs open spaces. In the Project
vicinity, bicycle lanes along Cahuenga Boulevard East, Cahuenga Boulevard West, and North
Cahuenga Boulevard are envisioned as part of the 2010 Bicycle Plan. However, none of these
proposed bicycle facilities are definitively scheduled for implementation, and they are not
expected prior to Project completion in year 2020.

                                    Project Trip Generation and Distribution


Trip generation estimates, trip distribution patterns and trip assignments were prepared for the
proposed Project. These components form the basis of the Projectâs traffic impact analysis.




PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The first step of the forecasting process is trip generation, which estimates the total arriving and
departing traffic volumes on a peak hour and daily basis by applying the appropriate vehicle trip
generation equations or rates to the amount of Project development.


The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound Project traffic volumes. These origins and destinations are
typically based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the Study Area.
Localized routes of travel through the Study Area are developed based on existing traffic patterns
and relative travel times on various corridors.


The third step of the forecasting process is traffic assignment. This involves applying the traffic
generated by the Project (the trip generation) to the intersections and street segments in the
Study Area according to the projected trip distribution patterns. These traffic volumes can then be
added to existing or future background conditions to represent traffic volumes once the Project is
complete.


With the forecasting process complete and Project traffic assignments developed, the impact of
the proposed Project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., LOS) conditions at the selected
key intersections using existing and expected future traffic volumes without and with forecast
Project traffic. The need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic improvements can
then be evaluated and the significance of the Projectâs impacts identified.




                                                                                                  45
Project Trip Generation


The typical resource utilized in determining the number of trips generated by a project is Trip
Generation, 9th Edition, which provides trip generation rates for a wide variety of land uses
based on surveys across the nation. However, the use and operational characteristics of the
Project are not similar to the available land use categories provided in Trip Generation, 9th
Edition. Therefore, trips generated by the Project were conservatively estimated based on the
anticipated unique operational characteristics of The Ford Theatres (i.e., attendance levels,
anticipated visitor arrival and departure patterns during weekdays and weekends, events,
educational, and other programming, employees, etc.) The number of trips expected to be
generated by the typical land use components of the Project (e.g., restaurant use) was
estimated using rates published in Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Trip generation for the office
uses is based on the number of existing and proposed employees and conservatively assumes
an average vehicle ridership (AVR) of 1.0 per employee vehicle.          Trip generation for the
Theatre spaces was calculated based on site-specific empirical data, which is summarized in
Appendix D. The trip generation associated with the Theatres also reflects the Project condition
that start times of simultaneous events in the Amphitheatre and 299-seat theatre on weekday
evenings (e.g., after 6:00 PM) will be staggered by a minimum of 45 minutes in order to
separate the arrival patterns of each theatreâs patrons. Table 6 summarizes the trip generation
rates for the proposed Project components.




Trip Generation Assumptions


The trip generation forecasts associated with the Project is based on information provided by
The Ford Theatres, and County staff (i.e., the Projectâs land use components, attendance
figures, anticipated visitor arrival and departure patterns, events, and other programming, etc.)
The trip generation associated with the Project is based on the following assumptions and
calculations found in Appendix D, as well as the following considerations:


   ï·     It is recognized that subsequent to the commencement of this traffic study, the old seats
       in the Amphitheatre were replaced, which resulted in a loss of four seats. Thus, the
       existing Amphitheatre provides 1,196 seats. However, for purposes of this traffic analysis,
       approximately 1,200 seats were assumed, which results in a conservative analysis.




                                                                                                46
ï·   The number of seats in the Amphitheatre will be maintained as part of the Project. The
    maximum capacity is 1,598 attendees, which represents sold out seats in all three
    Theatres (1,200 seat Amphitheatre, 299-seat theatre and Flex Space with up to 99 seats).

ï·   The start times of simultaneous events to be held in the Amphitheatre and 299-seat
    theatre on weekday evenings (e.g., after 6:00 PM) will be staggered by a minimum of 45
    minutes in order to separate the arrival patterns of each theatreâs patrons.

ï·   Theatre trip generation rates and in/out distribution based on traffic counts and attendance
    levels at The Ford Theatres on Friday, September 6, 2013 and Saturday, September 7,
    2013.

ï·   Peak hours used for analysis are as follows:

       o   AM Peak Hour â busiest one hour between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM (the commuter
           peak period)

       o   PM Peak Hour â busiest one hour between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM (the commuter
           peak period)

       o   Weekday Event Peak Hour â one hour preceding the event (7:00 PM to 8:00 PM
           for an 8:00 PM event)

       o   Saturday Midday Event Peak Hour â one hour preceding the event (11:00 AM to
           12:00 PM for a 12:00 PM event)

       o   Saturday Evening Event Peak Hour â one hour preceding the event (7:00 PM to
           8:00 PM for an 8:00 PM event)

ï·   A Theatre event will generally start around 8:00 PM for evening shows and 12:00 PM for
    midday shows, with attendees generally arriving within the one hour prior to the event (i.e.,
    7:00 PM or 11:00 AM).

ï·   Shuttle service connecting The Ford Theatres with the Universal City/Studio City Metro
    Red Line Station will be continued and enhanced with the Transit Center as part of the
    Project. Although the Project will continue to provide shuttle service, no additional
    reductions to account for attendees arriving via transit were assumed.

ï·   Event staff (e.g., security, event, public relations, etc.) are anticipated to arrive several
    hours prior to the event. For the purposes of this analysis, event staff were assumed to
    arrive one hour prior to the event start time and are included in the peak hour trip rate
    calculated in Appendix D.

ï·   To provide a conservative analysis, employees are anticipated to travel to the site via a
    single occupant vehicle (AVR of 1.0 person/per car). Accordingly, no additional reductions
    for employee carpooling, transit, or travel by non-automobile means (e.g., bicycle, walk,
    etc.) were considered in the trip generation forecast.

ï·   Based on information provided by the County, 85 employees will be on site, including 50
    Ford Theatre employees (on site 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and 35 County Parks & Recreation




                                                                                               47
       employees who arrive and depart outside of the weekday commuter peak periods (arrive
       by 6:00 AM, depart before 4:00 PM).

   ï·   Up to 140 employees may be relocated to the Project Site in place of the existing 140 Los
       Angeles Philharmonic employees that will be removed as part of the Project. Although the
       number of employees from other County Departments (e.g., Arts Commission) that are
       envisioned be relocated to the site is anticipated to be less, the traffic study assumes 140
       employees will remain on site so as to provide a conservative analysis.

   ï·   Based on information provided in the CARS Report, it is envisioned that the hiking trail will
       accommodate approximately 100 hikers per day, with approximately 5% weekday
       commuter peak hours usage and 10% Saturday midday peak hour usage.

   ï·   The restaurant uses will primarily support The Ford Theatres during events, but will be
       open to the public at other times. Thus, a 50% internal capture reduction was applied to
       account for the patrons also attending an event at The Ford Theatres, as well as a 15%
       transit reduction to account for visitors and employees that may use transit, based on the
       improved Transit Center and continued presence of a shuttle to/from the Universal
       City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station.



TRIP GENERATION SUMMARY


As described, the Project proposes to add 311 Theatre seats, a 5,400 sf restaurant, and
approximately 30 new regular shift employees in 13,660 sf of additional office space to the
existing development. Table 7 provides a summary of the trip generation estimates for the
Project.


As shown in Table 7, the Project is anticipated to generate 35 net new trips during the weekday
AM peak hour, 60 net new trips during the weekday PM peak hour, 18 net new trips during the
weekday event peak hour, 92 net new trips during the Saturday midday event peak hour, and
92 net new trips during the Saturday evening event peak hour.




Project Trip Distribution


Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the Project site have been distributed and
assigned to the local street system based on the location of nearby residential, entertainment
and employment centers and characteristics of the street system. The Project has access
to/from Cahuenga Boulevard East via four existing driveways and one proposed driveway.




                                                                                                  48
Project Trip Assignment


Project traffic was assigned to the surrounding street system based on splits found in the traffic
counts resulting in the following external distribution patterns: approximately 50% of the traffic
was assigned to/from the north and 50% was assigned to/from the south. Approximately 60% of
the traffic will utilize US-101 to/from the Project Site. The distribution of Project traffic through
the study intersections is illustrated in Figure 9 for both weekdays and Saturdays. The trip
distribution pattern was applied to the trip generation to develop the Project-only traffic
assignments, as illustrated in Figures 10A, 10B, and 10C for weekdays, weekday events, and
Saturdays, respectively.

           Trip generation rates and in/out distribution based on traffic counts and attendance levels on Friday, September 6, 2013
              and Saturday, September 7, 2013. The Amphitheatre currently provides 1,196 seats. Previously the Amphitheatre provided
              approximately 1,200 seats, however, replacement of the old seats in the Amphitheatre by the Ford Theatres resulted in a loss of 4 seats.
              For purposes of providing a conservative analysis, the Amphitheater was assumed to have a total of approximately 1,200 seats.

           PM peak hour generally represents the busiest one hour between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM (i.e. the commuter peak period)
       3
           Weekday Event peak hour generally represents the one hour preceding the start of the event (e.g. 7:00-8:00 PM for an 8:00 PM event)
       4
           Saturday Event peak hour generally represents the one hour preceding the start of the event.

           Based on information provided by Ford Theatre as part of the Project a total of 85 employees will be on-site, including 50 Ford Theatre
              employees (8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and 35 Parks & Recreation employees that arrive and depart outside of the commuter peak
              periods (arrive by 6:00 AM, depart before 4:00 PM). It should be noted that the employee numbers are overly conservative
              as they do not account for the existing 140 LA Phil employees that will be replaced with other County employees relocated to the site
              with the Project.

     Notes:
       1
        Ford Theatre traffic volumes during the Weekday PM Peak Hour includes staff (e.g., employees, setup crews, production managers, etc.) trips associated with operations of the theatres (Amphitheatre, 299-seat theatre, & multi-purpose flex space)
       2
        Weekday Evening Event Peak Hour reflects the Project Design Feature staggering of event start times between Amphitheatre and 299-seat theatre by a minimum of 45 minutes. Thus, a total of 1,299 seats is included for the weekday evening event peak hour analysis
              representing full occupancy of Amphitheatre and multi-purpose flex space (1,200 + 99 seats)
       3
        The restaurant uses will primarily support the Ford Theatres, but will be open to the public. Thus, an internal capture credit was applied to account for patrons also attending an event at the Ford Theatres.
       4
        Transit reduction to account for patrons and emplyees that may use transit, based on the improved Transit Plaza and continued presence of a shuttle to/from the Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station.
       5
        Based on information provided by Ford Theatre as part of the Project a total of 85 employees will be on-site, including 50 Ford Theatre employees (8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and 35 Parks & Recreation employees that arrive and depart outside of the commuter peak
              periods (arrive by 6:00 AM, depart before 4:00 PM). It should be noted that the employee numbers are overly conservative as they do not account for the existing 140 LA Phil employees that will be replaced by other County employees relocated onsite with the Project.

The combined Existing plus Project traffic volumes illustrated in Figures 11A, 11B, and 11C for
weekdays, weekday events, and Saturdays, respectively, were compared against the Existing
conditions analysis to identify any potential traffic impacts as a result of the Project. These
volumes are the result of the Project being constructed, to full buildout, without any ambient or
related project traffic growth.



INTERSECTION OPERATIONS

Existing Plus Project Intersection Levels of Service


Table 8 shows the results of the Existing plus Project analysis at the study intersections. As
shown in Table 8, the following intersections operate at LOS E or LOS F during at least one of
the analyzed peak hours:

    ï·   Int. 1: Cahuenga Boulevard West & Barham Boulevard (LOS E â Weekday
        AM/Weekday Event)
    ï·   Int. 2: Cahuenga Boulevard East & Barham Boulevard (LOS F â Weekday AM, LOS E â
        Weekday Event)
    ï·   Int. 5: Highland Avenue & Hollywood Bowl Road/US-101 Southbound On-Ramp (LOS E
        â Weekday AM/Weekday PM/Weekday Event)

The LOS calculation worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

                                                    Future with Project Conditions


This chapter describes the results of the analysis measuring the impact of Project traffic on the
future environment. The planning horizon for this analysis is the year 2020, corresponding with
the anticipated buildout year of the Project, and all future background traffic growth (i.e., ambient
growth and related project traffic) is assumed in this analysis.




TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Future Plus Project Traffic Volumes


The Project-only traffic volumes described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figures 10A, 10B, and
10C were added to the Future without Project traffic volumes shown in Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C.
The resulting Future with Project peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figures 12A, 12B, and
12C for weekdays, weekday events, and Saturdays, respectively. These volumes are the sum of
the existing traffic volumes, ambient growth, related project traffic, and Project-only traffic. They
represent Future with Project conditions, i.e., future conditions after the development of the
Project in the year 2020.




INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Future Plus Project (2020) Intersection LOS


The addition of Project traffic to the Future without Project traffic volumes result in the Future
plus Project traffic volumes illustrated in Figures 12A, 12B, and 12C. These volumes were
analyzed at each intersection and the results are summarized in Table 9.




                                                                                                   61
As shown in Table 9, the following intersections operate at LOS E or LOS F during one of the
peak hours analyzed:

The relative impact of the added Project traffic volumes during the peak hours was evaluated
based on analysis of both existing and future operating conditions at the study intersections
without and with the Project. The previously discussed significance criteria and thresholds
outlined in Chapter 2 were used to determine the significance of a traffic impact caused by the
Project on the study intersections. An evaluation of the unsignalized intersection is provided in
Appendix E. A detailed analysis of facilities under Caltrans jurisdiction is provided in Appendix
F.




EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS


LOS summaries under Existing plus Project conditions for the study intersections during the
weekday AM and PM commuter and event peak hours, as well as the Saturday midday event
and evening event peak hours are shown in Table 8.              As shown, application of the Cityâs
significant impact criteria to the Existing plus Project scenario indicates that although minor
increases in the V/C ratio are the result of Project traffic, no significant impacts result from
Project traffic at signalized intersections and no mitigation is required.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS


LOS summaries under Future plus Project conditions for the study intersections during the
weekday AM, PM, and event peak hours as well as the Saturday midday event and evening
event peak hours are shown in Table 9. As shown, application of the Cityâs significant impact
criteria to the Future plus Project scenario indicates that although minor increases in the V/C
ratio are the result of Project traffic, no significant impacts result from Project traffic at signalized
intersections and no mitigation is required.




                                                                                                       67
                                                                                 Chapter 9
                                             Parking and Traffic Management


As a Project design feature, the start times of simultaneous events to be held in the
Amphitheatre and 299-seat theatre on weekday evenings (e.g., after 6:00 PM) will be staggered
by a minimum of 45 minutes in order to separate the arrival patterns of each theatreâs patrons.
This condition has been reflected in the traffic analysis of weekday evening conditions included
in this study.   With implementation of this condition, the Projectâs impacts on the study
intersections are anticipated to be less than significant.   Thus, no mitigation measures are
required.


The Project also includes preparation and implementation of a PTMP to minimize the effect of
parking and traffic on the surrounding street system. The PTMP includes parking and traffic
management measures, operational measures, transportation demand management (TDM)
measures, etc., to further reduce and manage parking and traffic at The Ford Theatres for both
event days and non-event days, to the extent feasible.




PARKING AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN


A PTMP would be implemented to minimize potential parking and traffic related-impacts on the
surrounding street system to the extent feasible. Components of the plan include parking and
traffic event management measures such as directional signage, operational/scheduling
measures, identification of additional parking supplies, etc. The PTMP would also include a
selection of parking and traffic management strategies, which are intended to effectively
manage and direct event related parking and traffic associated with a Theatre event on
weekdays and weekends. The PTMP strategies may include, but not necessarily be limited to,
the following:




                                                                                              68
   ï·   Provide directions and location maps with the parking options available for visitors in
       website postings, real time mobile applications, marketing, notification and media
       materials, etc.

   ï·   Post directions and maps showing truck routes for deliveries, construction vehicles, and
       other trucks.

   ï·   Encourage alternate travel options (transit and shuttle service) in event-related
       marketing/media information.

   ï·   Manage the use of all parking spaces in the on-site parking garages to maximize parking
       efficiency and avoid underutilization of parking spaces.

   ï·   Identify locations for bus drop-off/pick-up and staging.

   ï·   Provide valet assist parking in the parking garages to maximize parking circulation and
       capacity where possible during large events.

   ï·   Require employees and staff to park within designated areas.

The PTMP would also encompass TDM strategies that would encourage visitors and employees
to reduce vehicular traffic on the adjacent streets during the peak hours and parking demand by
promoting carpooling and non-auto travel through pedestrian-friendly designs and orientation
that facilitates transit use. Although Project traffic could be further reduced with implementation
of TDM strategies, no additional trip reductions were assumed for the purposes of this analysis.


The TDM strategies may include the following:


       ï·   Carpool promotions and support
       ï·   Bicycle amenities (bicycle racks, lockers, etc.)
       ï·   Flexible or alternative work schedules and programs
       ï·   Transit incentives (e.g., discounted transit passes)
       ï·   Parking incentives for carpools and vanpools




                                                                                                 69

                             Congestion Management Program Analysis


CMP ANALYSIS


The CMP requires that, when a TIA is prepared for a project, traffic and transit impact analyses
be conducted for select regional facilities based on the amount of project traffic expected to use
these facilities. The analyses were conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in the
CMP Appendix D, âGuidelines for CMP Transportation Impact Analysis.â




CMP SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACT CRITERIA


The CMP guidelines state that a CMP freeway analysis must be conducted if 150 or more trips
attributable to the proposed development are added to a mainline freeway monitoring location in
either direction during the weekday morning or afternoon commuter peak hours. Similarly, a
CMP arterial monitoring station analysis must be conducted if 50 or more peak hour project trips
are added to a CMP arterial monitoring station during the weekday morning or afternoon
commuter peak hours.


A significant project-related CMP impact would be identified if the CMP facility is projected to
operate at LOS F (V/C > 1.00) and if the project traffic causes an incremental change in the V/C
ratio of 0.02 or greater. The proposed development would not be considered to have a
regionally significant impact, regardless of the increase in V/C ratio, if the analyzed facility is
projected to operate at LOS E or better after the addition of the Project traffic.




                                                                                                 70
CMP FREEWAY ANALYSIS


Based on the Project trip generation estimates shown in Table 7, the Project is expected to
generate approximately 35 trips in the weekday AM peak hour, approximately 60 trips in the
weekday PM peak hour, approximately 18 trips in the weekday event peak hour, approximately
92 trips in the Saturday midday event peak hour, and approximately 92 trips in the Saturday
evening event peak hour. According to the Project trip distribution illustrated in Figures 10A,
10B, and 10C, there would be fewer than 150 AM or PM peak hour trips distributed to the
freeways in the Project area; therefore, the Projectâs CMP freeway impacts are considered to be
less than significant and no further analysis is required.




CMP ARTERIAL MONITORING STATION ANALYSIS


The CMP arterial monitoring stations closest to the Project site include the intersections of:


   ï·   Santa Monica Boulevard & Highland Avenue, approximately one and one-half miles south
       of the Project site
   ï·   Cahuenga Boulevard & Lankershim Boulevard, approximately two and one-quarter miles
       northwest of the Project site

According to the Project trip distribution illustrated in Figures 10A, 10B, and 10C, there would be
nominal Project trips traveling past the monitoring stations at Santa Monica Boulevard &
Highland Avenue and Cahuenga Boulevard & Lankershim Boulevard. It is estimated that there
would be fewer than five trips added to each of these arterial monitoring stations during both the
weekday morning and afternoon peak hours. Therefore, the Projectâs CMP arterial impacts are
considered to be less than significant, and no further analysis is required on these arterial
monitoring stations.




REGIONAL TRANSIT IMPACT ANALYSIS


Section B.8.4 of the CMP provides a methodology for estimating the number of transit trips
expected to result from a proposed project based on the number of vehicle trips.                 This
methodology assumes AVR factor of 1.4 in order to estimate the number of person trips to and



                                                                                                   71
from the project and then provides guidance regarding the percentage of person trips assigned
to public transit based on the type of land use and the proximity to transit service. The CMP
guidelines estimate that approximately 3.5% of total Project person trips may use public transit
to travel to and from the Project Site based on the type of use of the Project.


As shown in Table 7, prior to mitigation, the Project is anticipated to generate approximately 35
weekday morning peak hour trips and 60 weekday afternoon peak hour trips. Assuming an
AVR of 1.4, the Projectâs vehicle trips result in an estimated increase of 49 person trips during
the weekday morning peak hour and 84 person trips during the afternoon peak hour. Using the
3.5% mode split suggested in the CMP, the Project would generate approximately three net new
transit trips in the weekday morning peak hour and two net new transit trips in the weekday
afternoon peak hour.


As detailed in Chapter 3, the Study Area is served by numerous established transit routes.
Distribution of the transit trips to these lines would result in less than one new transit user for
each transit line during the peak hours. The total available capacity of the transit lines within the
Study Area during the morning and afternoon peak hours is anticipated to more than
accommodate the few net additional trips during morning and afternoon peak hours. Therefore,
impacts on existing or future transit services in the Study Area are anticipated to be minimal and
less than significant.




                                                                                                   72
                                                                                   Chapter 11
                             Project Site Access and Internal Circulation


This Chapter summarizes the site access and internal circulation of the Project.




EXISTING SITE ACCESS AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION


As mentioned, access to the Project Site is provided via four driveways along the east side of
Cahuenga Boulevard East. The driveway at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge
provides primary access to the Project Site. During events, this driveway is used for patrons
entering by passenger vehicle and for shuttle access from the Universal City/Studio City Metro
Red Line Station. During non-event times, this driveway serves as the main ingress and egress
point for employees and vendors. This driveway is signalized and accommodates full access
(i.e., both left-turn and right-turn ingress and egress turning movements).


The northernmost driveway, located approximately 550 feet north of the intersection of
Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, is primarily used for egress after events and is
occasionally used for overflow stacked parking. At this driveway, Cahuenga Boulevard East is a
one-way northbound street; therefore, this driveway accommodates right-turn ingress and
egress turning movements only (left turns are prohibited).


The two southern driveways, located approximately 300 feet and 650 feet south of the
intersection of Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, are primarily used for access to
and from the southern surface parking lot during events. These driveways are generally closed
during on non-event days/periods.


During events, the surface parking areas operate in a stacked parking configuration. Further
description of traffic and parking conditions observed during an event is provided in Appendix A.




                                                                                               73
PROPOSED SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Vehicles

Access to the Project Site would continue to be available via the four existing driveways along
the east side of Cahuenga Boulevard East with some configuration and circulation
modifications.


To facilitate access and circulation within the Transit Center, the Project proposes to add a fifth
driveway on Cahuenga Boulevard East, to be located 150 feet north of Pilgrimage Bridge, that
would serve as an exit-only driveway for the Transit Center. The proposed driveway would
provide right-turn-only egress from the Transit Center and Parking Structure 2.


The driveway at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge, which currently provides
primary access to the Project Site, would be maintained in its existing location and
configuration. This driveway would provide access for the parking structures, internal roadways,
and Transit Center, and will continue to accommodate both left-turn and right-turn ingress and
egress turning movements.


The northernmost driveway, which is currently used primarily for egress after events, would be
reconfigured internally to provide direct access to the proposed maintenance facility and allow
egress from Parking Structure 2. This driveway would continue to accommodate right turns in
and out only.


The southern driveways would be maintained in their existing locations with the southernmost
driveway providing ingress to Parking Structure 1 and the other driveway providing egress.
Ingress and egress to Parking Structure 1 would also be provided from the main entrance.


The internal roadway that leads from Pilgrimage Bridge to the upper gate area would serve as
the performer entrance to the lower level Amphitheatre support spaces, as well as providing
access for shuttle and vehicular loading and unloading, trash pickup, media truck parking, and
fire truck access.




                                                                                                 74
Pedestrians and Bicycles


Sidewalks are currently provided on the east side (Project side) of Cahuenga Boulevard East
between the north end of the Project Site and the Study Area limit to the south. Within the
Project Site, pedestrian access to the Amphitheatre would continue to be provided at the main
gate. In addition, new pedestrian pathways would be provided for access to the new areas.
The upper gate area would be modified to provide a loading dock and stage loading area to
serve events and general facility maintenance such as trash and recycling pickup as well as fire
department access.


Visitors arriving by bicycle would have the same access opportunities as pedestrian visitors.
The Project would also include bicycle amenities (e.g., bicycle parking and bicycle-friendly
amenities) located throughout.




Transit Center


The Ford Theatre-sponsored shuttles, providing service between the Project Site and the
Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station, would continue to be provided as part of the
Project. The Transit Center includes a designated area for bus and valet drop-off. Circulation
through the Transit Center would operate in a counterclockwise pattern, with ingress via the
primary access at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge and egress via the new
driveway located to the north.




                                                                                              75

                                                                        Parking Analysis



This chapter summarizes the assessment of parking, including the existing and future parking
supply, parking demand characteristics, and parking management measures.




EXISTING PARKING SUPPLY AND OPERATIONS


Surface parking areas comprised of both asphalt and dirt are located along Cahuenga
Boulevard East (the north parking lot and the south parking lot), as well as near the upper gate.
On non-event days and times, parking for employees is accommodated within the surface
parking areas. During events, the Project Site currently provides parking for approximately 350-
380 vehicles in a stacked parking configuration to support the existing Amphitheatre and [Inside]
The Ford Theatre. During events, a shuttle is provided to and from the Ford Theatres from the
Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station. The stacked parking configuration on site is
very inefficient from both a patron experience and operational standpoint. For example, patrons
must wait for vehicles parked in front of them to move in order to exit the parking areas. A
detailed description of the observed pre-event loading and parking operations is provided in
Appendix A.




FUTURE PARKING SUPPLY


The Project is designed to improve existing services and facilities on the Project Site and is
envisioned to update and enhance the overall experiences at The Ford for visitors, patrons, staff
and others. As such, the parking demand characteristics and usage of on-site parking spaces
at The Ford during non-event and event days will be similar with the development of the Project.
In total, the Project will have approximately 311 additional theatre seats as compared to existing
conditions. The Project includes 13,660 sf of additional office space, for a total of 24,160 sf, and




                                                                                                  76
a 5,400 sf quality restaurant. Parking will primarily be provided in two new parking garages,
Parking Structure 1 (south) and Parking Structure 2 (north), which provide approximately 500
striped parking spaces in a self-park configuration. Additional vehicles can be accommodated
on site with use of attendant/valet stacked parking operations. The proposed parking garages,
including self-park configurations, will improve parking efficiencies, as well as patron
experience, by reducing the need for stacked parking throughout the Project Site for every
event.


Generally, the following types of parking spaces will be accommodated depending on the time
of day and anticipated operating conditions (e.g., event attendance):

   ï·     Patron Self-Parking
   ï·     Employee Self-Parking
   ï·     Employee/Patron Attendant/Valet Stacked Parking

Patron Self-Parking consists of sections of the on-site parking lot and garages that will be
available for patrons of the Theatres to park their own vehicles without assistance from valets or
parking attendants. The proposed parking garages will provide approximately 500 spaces in an
on-site self-park configuration that can be used by patrons or employees with completion of the
Project.


Employee Self-Parking consists of sections of the on-site parking lot and garages that will be
available for employees (both the Theatres and restaurant) to park their own vehicles without
assistance from valets or parking attendants. The proposed parking garages will provide
approximately 500 spaces in an on-site self-park configuration that can be used by patrons or
employees with completion of the Project.


Employee/Patron Attendant/Valet Stacked Parking consists of sections of the on-site parking
lots and garages that will be utilized for stacked parking spaces. With the assistance of parking
lot attendants, employees and patrons may stack park their vehicles in the least desirable
portion of the on-site parking areas, so as to maximize utilization of the available on-site parking
spaces. It is conservatively estimated that a net increase of 75 vehicles (representing
approximately 15% increase in supply) may be accommodated on site with attendant/valet
stacked parking.




                                                                                                  77
PARKING DEMAND


Attendance levels and parking demands of the Project will fluctuate depending on the activities,
programs and events held, as well as by time of the year (e.g., holidays), day of the week
(weekday and weekend), and time of day. Therefore, an assessment of parking demand was
prepared for several potential Project operational conditions, including variation in attendance
levels. The peak parking demand for the Project was evaluated based on a combination of the
unique operational characteristics, including attendance levels, anticipated visitor arrival and
departure patterns, events, and other programming, etc., empirical data from the existing Ford
Theatre operations, industry-wide parking demand rates, AVR rates, mode split, and internal
capture, as well as attendance and employee data, etc. Parking demands were based on
attendance and number of employees. The parking demand reflects the time in the season
when total attendance is at its highest levels, when the Amphitheatre is in operation. Parking
demand during other times of the year when the Amphitheatre is not in use would be less.


For purposes of this parking analysis, adjustments consistent with the trip generation forecast
and traffic analysis were considered to account for mode split (e.g., arriving by transit, walk,
bicycle, etc.), as well as internal capture (e.g., between the restaurant and Theatres). So as to
provide a conservative analysis, and consistent with the trip generation forecast, other
employees (e.g., Ford, Arts Commission, Parks and Recreation, etc.) were assumed to arrive in
a single-occupant vehicle.


Table 10 presents the peak parking demand for operations on non-event days when the office
employees (e.g., Arts Commission, Parks and Recreation, etc.) and restaurant patrons and
employees, as well as hikers, are expected to be on site. It is assumed that all restaurant
patrons would be on site simultaneously. This results in a peak parking demand of 291 spaces
on a non-event day.


Table 11 presents the peak parking demand for event conditions with an attendance level of up
to 1,100 patrons/seats in a combination of the Theatres, along with the associated employees
and restaurant use. Consistent with the trip generation forecast, adjustments were considered
to account for mode split, as well as internal capture between the restaurant and Theatres. This
results in a peak parking demand of 427 spaces.

Table 12 presents peak parking demand for event conditions based on an attendance of 1,101
to 1,300 patrons in a combination of the Theatres, along with associated employees and
restaurant use. Consistent with the trip generation forecast, adjustments were considered to
account for mode split, as well as internal capture between the restaurant and Theatres. This
results in a peak parking demand of 484 parking spaces.


Table 13 presents peak parking demand for event conditions based on an attendance of 1,301
or more patrons, which represents a sold out condition (Amphitheatre + 299-seat Theatre + 99
seat multi-purpose flex space), along with associated employees and restaurant use.
Consistent with the trip generation forecast, adjustments were considered to account for mode
split, as well as internal capture between the restaurant and Theatres. This results in a peak
parking demand of 568 parking spaces.


Parking demand for the different operational conditions of the Project will be accommodated
through the use of the on-site parking facilities, operational measures to increase parking supply
within the existing site (i.e., attendant/stacked parking), employee parking management, and
continued use of the shuttles from the Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station for
patrons and employees. As described in the following section, a PTMP will be implemented to
manage peak parking demands for operations on non-event and event conditions.


The strategies to satisfy on-site parking demand of the Project for the various operational
scenarios are detailed in Table 14.      As shown, parking for non-event conditions can be
accommodated within the on-site parking supply in a self-park configuration.           For event
conditions with attendance up to 1,300 patrons, parking can be accommodated within the on-
site parking supply in a self-park configuration.     Attendant/stacked on-site parking will be
required on event days with attendance of 1,301 or more patrons in the Theatres.


Table 14 summarizes how the parking demand of each operational scenario could be
accommodated within the on-site parking supply with the strategies outlined as part of the
PTMP. These strategies may include self-park spaces, use of attendant/stacked parking on site
as required, as well as continued use of shuttle service from Universal City/Studio City Metro
Red Line Station for patrons and employees. The total parking supply will be managed through
the PTMP so that the parking demands are met throughout the day for weekday and weekend
conditions for various event attendance levels and operations. The PTMP reflects the use of



                                                                                                79
the available parking supply for both non-event and event conditions.          Thus, the parking
demand is fully accommodated for each of the operational scenarios. As such, with
implementation of the PTMP, parking impacts are determined to be less than significant.




PTMP


Parking management measures are recommended and incorporated as part of the Project to
minimize parking-related impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, manage parking demands,
and improve parking efficiencies at The Ford for both non-event and event conditions. These
measures are included in the PTMP, outlined in Chapter 9.


As previously described, parking demand is highly influenced by weather and the programming
and scheduling of events, as well as the anticipated attendance levels on any given day. One
or more parking demand management measures will be implemented based on the type of day
(i.e., event days, non-event days, etc.), anticipated attendance levels and the nature of the
events (e.g., attendance, scheduling, arrival and departure patterns, parking demand, etc.) The
parking demand management measures would be structured so as to maximize the use of the
on-site parking areas, and continued use of the shuttle to the Universal City/Studio City Metro
Red Line Station.


The PTMP management strategies also include employee transportation demand management
measures (e.g., transit incentives, employee carpooling programs, etc.), attendant/valet parking,
employee parking programs (e.g., designated employee parking areas), parking guide signs,
updated parking technological measures, patron ticketing controls, etc. The total parking supply
will be managed so that the parking demands are met throughout the day for various
operational conditions that may occur on either weekdays or weekends. The strategies to
accommodate the peak parking demands for the various operational scenarios include self-park
spaces, use of attendant/stacked parking on site, and continued use of shuttle services from
Universal City/Studio City Metro Red Line Station for patrons and employees.

                                                     Construction Impact Analysis



This chapter summarizes the construction schedule and construction impact analysis for the
Project. The analysis relates to the temporary impacts that may result from the construction
activities of the Project, which may include safety, operational, or capacity impacts.




TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS


The factors used to determine the significance of a projectâs impacts involve the likelihood and
extent to which an impact might occur, the potential inconvenience caused to a population, and
consideration for public safety. Potential traffic impacts from construction activities could be
expected to occur as a result of the following types of activities:


    ï·   Increases in truck traffic associated with export of fill materials and delivery of
        construction materials

    ï·   Increases in automobile traffic associated with construction workers traveling to and from
        the site

    ï·   Reductions in existing street capacity or on-street parking from temporary lane closures
        necessary for the construction of roadway improvements, utility relocation, and drainage
        facilities

    ï·   Blocking existing vehicle or pedestrian access to other parcels fronting street


The impact of construction truck traffic (including haul trucks) would be a lessening of the
capacities of access streets and haul routes due to the slower movements and larger turning
radii of trucks.




                                                                                                86
PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE


For purposes of analyzing the worst case scenario associated with construction, the Project was
assumed to be completed in one phase. However, it is recognized that the Project is likely to be
constructed over time, as funding allows and to keep The Ford Theatres operating during the
event season. Construction of the Project is anticipated to be completed as early as 2020. The
anticipated construction phases include site clearing, grading and excavation, and construction
of new buildings, plaza, and landscape areas.




CONSTRUCTION WORKERS


Construction worker traffic impacts depends on the number of construction workers employed
during various construction phases, as well as the travel mode and travel time of the workers. In
general, the hours of construction typically require workers to be on site before the weekday
morning commuter peak period and allow them to leave before or after the afternoon commuter
peak period (i.e., arrive at the site prior to 7:00 AM and depart before 4:00 PM or after 6:00 PM).
Therefore, most, if not all, of the construction worker trips would occur outside of the typical
weekday commuter or weekend midday peak periods.


The estimated number of construction workers each day depending on the phase of
construction (e.g., demolition, grading, building construction, etc.) is anticipated to range
between approximately 10 and 100 workers. Assuming some level of carpooling among the
construction workers, an AVR of 1.135 persons per vehicle was applied, as provided in CEQA
Air Quality Handbook (South Coast Air Quality Management District, 1993). Thus, during the
construction phase with the largest number of workers (e.g., building construction), the
estimated number of daily trips due to 100 construction workers is approximately 176 (88
inbound and 88 outbound trips), with all of these trips occurring outside of the peak hours.


During construction, adequate parking for construction workers would be provided within the
boundaries of the Project Site. Restrictions against workers parking in the public right-of-way in
the vicinity of (or adjacent to) the Project Site will be identified as part of the Construction
Management Plan. Construction parking may require use of on-site parking areas for materials
storage and truck staging. However, construction schedules, storage and staging, and the



                                                                                                 87
provisions for parking spaces for construction workers will be planned so as to minimize the
reduction in parking to The Ford Theatres staff and patrons. Therefore, Project construction
would result in a less than significant impact with regard to the availability of parking spaces.




PROPOSED TRUCK ACTIVITY

Haul Trucks


During the course of the combined excavation, demolition, and other construction activities, it is
estimated that a total of approximately 107,094 cubic yards (CY) of material would be exported
to various landfills likely located in the Cities of Irwindale, Whittier, and Santa Maria. It is
anticipated that 12-14 CY dirt trucks would be used to export the soil. With approximately 720
CY of export per day, a total of 64 truck trips per day is anticipated associated with excavation
and demolition. Thus, up to 64 daily haul trips (32 inbound, 32 outbound) are forecast to occur
during the excavation and demolition periods, with approximately 14 trips per hour (seven
inbound, seven outbound), assuming haul truck trips would occur uniformly over an five-hour
period.


A Haul Truck Route program will be required as part of the Countyâs permitting process. The
truck haul routes would comply with the approved truck routes designated within the City and
County of Los Angeles. Outbound traffic would travel northbound on Cahuenga Boulevard East
to US-101 and inbound traffic would travel northbound on Cahuenga Boulevard East from US-
101.




Delivery Trucks


Project construction would also require delivery of construction materials. An average of
between less than 10 and 30 daily delivery truck trips to the Project Site are envisioned
depending on the construction phase.        The phase with the largest number of deliveries is
anticipated to occur during the building construction phase, with approximately 30 daily delivery
trips (15 inbound, 15 outbound) are envisioned, which corresponds to approximately six trips




                                                                                                    88
per hour (three inbound, three outbound), assuming delivery truck trips would occur uniformly
over a five-hour period.




Passenger Car Equivalent Trips


Assuming a passenger car equivalency (PCE) factor of 2.0, the 64 off-site haul trucks and 30
delivery trucks would be equivalent to 94 passenger car trips per day. Transportation Research
Circular No. 212, Interim Materials on Highway Capacity (Transportation Research Board, 1980)
defines PCE for a vehicle as the number of through moving passenger cars to which it is
equivalent based on the vehicleâs headway and delay-creating effects. Table 8 of Transportation
Research Circular No. 212 and Exhibit 16.7 of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(Transportation Research Board, 2000) suggest a PCE of 2.0 for trucks.




POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC


As described above, Project construction at its most intense phases is expected to generate
approximately 176 daily worker trips and 94 PCE daily truck trips, which account for off-site
hauling and deliveries, most of which are anticipated to occur during off-peak hours. Because a
majority of construction traffic would occur during off-peak hours, Project construction is not
expected to cause a significant traffic impact at any of the analyzed intersections. In order to
minimize the effect of construction-related traffic on the surrounding street system, all
construction workers, haul trucks and delivery trucks would be prohibited from parking, staging,
or queuing along the adjacent public streets.         With implementation of a Construction
Management Plan, construction traffic impacts at study intersections would be less than
significant.




POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON ACCESS, TRANSIT, AND PARKING


Construction activities are expected to be primarily contained within the Project Site boundaries
and would generally not affect the adjacent street access, transit or parking in the area. The
adjacent bus stop and route along Cahuenga Boulevard East will be maintained during



                                                                                               89
construction to the extent feasible. Thus, temporary loss of bus stops or rerouting of bus lines is
not anticipated. Project construction is not expected to create hazards for roadway travelers,
bus riders, or parkers, so long as commonly practiced safety procedures for construction are
followed. Such procedures and other measures (e.g., to address temporary traffic control, lane
closures, sidewalk closures, relocation of bus stops, etc.) have been incorporated into the
Construction Management Plan. With implementation of the Construction Management Plan,
construction-related impacts are anticipated to be less than significant.




CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN


A detailed Construction Management Plan, including street closure information, detour plans, haul
routes, and staging plans, would be prepared and submitted to the County for review and
approval. The Construction Management Plan would formalize how construction would be carried
out and identify specific actions that would be required to reduce effects on the surrounding
community. The Construction Management Plan shall be based on the nature and timing of the
specific construction activities and other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site, and should
include the following elements as appropriate:


   ï·   Prohibition of construction worker parking on adjacent residential streets

   ï·   Prohibition of construction equipment or material deliveries within the public right-of-way

   ï·   Provisions for temporary traffic control during all construction activities adjacent to public
       right-of-way to improve traffic flow on public roadways (e.g., flag person)

   ï·   Scheduling of construction activities to reduce the effect on traffic flow on surrounding
       arterial streets

   ï·   Construction-related vehicles shall not park on surrounding public streets

   ï·   Provisions of safety precautions for pedestrians and bicyclists through such measures as
       alternate routing and protection barriers as appropriate

   ï·   Provisions to accommodate the equipment storage and truck staging on site

   ï·   Scheduling of construction-related deliveries, haul trips, etc., so as to occur outside the
       commuter peak hours to the extent feasible

   ï·   Obtaining the required permits for truck haul routes from the City prior to issuance of any
       permit for the Project



                                                                                                     90

Observations were conducted at the Ford Theatre on a weekday and weekend to document the
traffic and parking operations, management, circulation patterns, etc. for an event. The following
provides a summary of the observations conducted on Friday and Saturday, September 6 and
7, 2013. It should be noted that both the Ford Theatre and Hollywood Bowl were holding events
on these days.




PARKING LAYOUT


The Ford Theatre consists of several surface parking areas throughout the site. For purposes
of documenting observations conducted at the site, the site was separated into seven parking
areas and four driveways, numbered 1-7 and 1-4, respectively, in Figure A-1. Parking Lots 1, 3,
4, and 5 are used for general stacked parking, Parking Lot 2 is used for short-term parking,
Parking Lot 6 is used for disabled parking, and Parking Lot 7 is used for producer/performer
parking. The main driveway at Cahuenga Boulevard East & Pilgrimage Bridge (Driveway 1) is
open for entry before events; all driveways are open for exit after events.




STACKED PARKING OPERATIONS


General Parking


Parking Lot 1 is the first lot filled during an event. As vehicles enter from Driveway 1, there are
two to four attendants who are able to collect payment from two vehicles at a time, side-by-side,
as shown in Exhibits 1-2. After payment, the vehicles are directed toward Parking Lot 1 and
park in a stacked parking configuration until full.




                                                                                                A-1

There are two to four attendants who are able to collect payment from two vehicles at a time,
side-by-side, as shown in Exhibit 3. After payment, the vehicles are directed to Parking Lot 5
and, when Parking Lot 5 is full, to Parking Lot 4.




                                             Exhibit 3



Disabled Parking


Disabled parking is provided in Parking Lots 3 and 6. Initially, vehicles needing disabled parking
are directed toward the six parking spaces in Parking Lot 6. Once those spaces are filled,
vehicles are directed to Parking Lot 3.




PARKING LOT OPERATIONS


General parking is provided in Parking Lots 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, all of which accommodate vehicles
in a stacked parking configuration. Disabled parking is accommodated in Parking Lots 3 and 6.
Parking lots are carefully and specifically loaded until the site reaches capacity. For general
patron parking, vehicles are stacked beginning in Parking Lot 1, then Parking Lot 5, then
Parking Lot 4. For disabled parking, vehicles are parked beginning in parking Lot 6, then in



                                                                                               A-4
Parking Lot 3. Producer and performer parking is accommodated in Parking Lot 7. Further
description of the vehicular circulation and parking operations for the parking lots is provided in
the following paragraphs.




Parking Lot 1


Vehicles are loaded into Parking Lot 1 beginning from the north end of the lot to the south end,
until the final row of vehicles is parked. As vehicles enter Parking Lot 1, the attendants direct
them to toward the north end of the lot (with the vehicles facing north) along the west side of the
parking lot first (Exhibit 4). The space immediately in front of Driveway 3 is left open to allow for
circulation upon exiting.




                                              Exhibit 4

Once the main portion of the parking lot is filled, the attendants start directing the vehicles to the
south end of the lot to accommodate a final row of vehicles facing toward Driveway 3 (Exhibit 5).




                                                                                                   A-5
                                             Exhibit 5

At the end of the event, the vehicles are able to drive straight out of Driveways 2 and 3 to exit
onto Cahuenga Boulevard East. Once the southern portion of Parking Lot 1 is full, attendants
direct the vehicles to the north end of the lot, in front of the main Theatre entrance, with vehicles
parked facing west (Exhibit 6). The area directly in front of Driveway 2 is left open to allow
enough space for the Ford Theatre shuttle to exit.




                                             Exhibit 6



                                                                                                  A-6
Parking Lot 2


Parking Lot 2 provides very limited parking in an unpaved and unmarked area. Vehicles are
parked in the dirt areas under the trees on the sides of the driveway leading up to the main
theatre entrance and Parking Lot 1 (Exhibit 7).




                                               Exhibit 7



Parking Lot 3

Parking Lot 3 accommodates disabled parking and is accessed directly from Driveway 1
throughout the night. This lot also accommodates some employee parking in a stacked
configuration at the north end of the lot, as well as in front of the office building.


When Parking Lot 6 is full, attendants direct vehicles needing disabled parking to park in
Parking Lot 3, in a stacked parking configuration. Vehicles are parked beginning along the west
side of the parking lot (Cahuenga Boulevard East side) facing Driveway 1 (Exhibit 8).




                                                                                            A-7
                                            Exhibit 8

There is stacked parking for employees/show producers at the north end of the lot (Exhibit 9).




                                            Exhibit 9




                                                                                                 A-8
The area located immediately south of the Driveway 1 is also used to park a limited number of
vehicles (Exhibit 10).




                                            Exhibit 10



Parking Lots 4 and 5


After Parking Lot 1 is full, Parking Lots 4 and 5 are filled. Vehicles are loaded into Parking Lot 5
beginning from the south end of the lot to the north end, until full. Vehicles are directed to
circulate toward the north end of the lot then turn around toward the south such that vehicles are
facing south. The last row of vehicles entering Parking Lot 5 park facing north (Exhibit 11).




                                                                                                 A-9
                                           Exhibit 11


Once Parking Lot 5 is full, vehicles are directed to Parking Lot 4, where they park facing south
(Exhibits 12 and 13).




                                           Exhibit 12




                                                                                            A-10
                                          Exhibit 13

The last vehicles are parked along Driveway 4 facing west and are able to proceed straight onto
Cahuenga Boulevard East after the show (Exhibit 14).




                                          Exhibit 14




                                                                                           A-11
Parking Lot 6

The first vehicles to arrive that need disabled parking are directed to Parking Lot 6, which is
located at the top of the hill north of the Amphitheatre and contains six disabled parking spaces.
The cul-de-sac at the easterly terminus, provides a turn-around area for vehicles (Exhibit 15).




                                             Exhibit 15



Parking Lot 7


Performers and producers park within Parking Lot 7, which is the parking area along the north
side of the internal roadway that extends between Driveway 1 and Parking Lot 6. Vehicles
travel east along the internal roadway, turn around at the cul-de-sac around Parking Lot 6, then
travel west to parallel park along the curb (Exhibit 16).




                                                                                              A-12
                                            Exhibit 16



SHUTTLE


Shuttle service is provided between the Ford Theatre and the Universal City/Studio City Metro
Red Line Station. The shuttle enters through Driveway 1. If there are disabled passengers, the
shuttle drives to Parking Lot 6 for unloading of those passengers. If no disabled entry is
required, the shuttle drives to the theatre main entrance for drop-off (Exhibit 17). After drop-off,
the shuttle exits from Driveway 2 onto Cahuenga Boulevard East.




                                                                                                A-13
                                             Exhibit 17



OTHER OBSERVATIONS

During the observations, some vehicles attempted to stop at the main theatre entrance to drop-
off passengers. Due to the limited space at the entrance, this resulted in some queuing for the
vehicles traveling to Parking Lot 1 (Exhibit 18).




                                                                                           A-14
                                              Exhibit 18

School bus drop-off was accommodated at the existing Metro bus stop on Cahuenga Boulevard
East just north of Driveway 1 (Exhibit 19).

There are no pedestrian walkways or sidewalks that connect Parking Lots 4 and 5 to the
Amphitheater. As such patrons were observed maneuvering around entering vehicles entering
to make their way to the theatre (Exhibit 20).
