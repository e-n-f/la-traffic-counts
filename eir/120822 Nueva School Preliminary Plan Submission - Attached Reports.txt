                                           July 2, 2012



Summary of Key Findings
Key findings of the existing conditions assessment are summarized below:
        The proposed campus enrollment increase under the Draft Master Plan
        would be very unlikely to result in significant off-site transportation impacts
        based on the following:
        -   Skyline Boulevard currently serves approximately 4,500 daily vehicle trips, well
            below the Town's LOS C threshold of 8,800 vehicle trips.
        -   The proposed enrollment increase would generate an increase of less than 400 daily
            vehicle trips.
        -   Peak hour volumes would be dispersed, as summarized below and described in
            greater detail within the body of this report, such that the peak volume in any one
            direction would not be anticipated to significantly impact operations at any off-site
            intersection.

Traffic Volumes
Nueva School currently generates 1,300 to 1,500 daily weekday vehicle trips, including:
        420 AM Peak Hour vehicle trips during the morning student drop-off period from 8:00 to
        9:00 AM
        299 PM School Peak Hour vehicle trips during the afternoon student pick-up period from
        3:00 to 4:00 PM.
The proposed Campus Master Plan has identified a potential enrollment increase of up to 100
students, representing a 25 percent increase over existing conditions. Based on the current rate
of traffic generation, the forecasted increase in vehicle trips would be:
        Daily traffic (weekday): +378 vehicle trips (50% inbound / 50% outbound)
        AM Peak Hour (8:00 to 9:00 AM): +105 vehicle trips (58% inbound / 42%
        outbound)
        PM School Peak Hour (3:00 to 4:00 PM): +75 vehicle trips (48% inbound / 52%
        outbound)
Skyline Boulevard currently carries approximately 4,500 weekday vehicle trips, well
below the typical capacity of a 2-lane arterial or collector street.
        Based on the Town's LOS C threshold for 2-lane Minor Arterial Streets,
        Skyline Boulevard can accommodate a total daily volume of 8,800 daily
        vehicles (approximately double the current daily traffic volume).
        Therefore, the forecasted increase in daily traffic generated by Nueva School would fall
        well below this threshold.
Based on the peak hour trip generation forecast, the predicted distribution of north/south and
inbound/outbound trips during the peak hours would be as follows:
        Skyline Boulevard to/from south:
        -   AM Peak Hour: +69 trips (40 northbound & 29 southbound)
        -   PM School Peak Hour: +51 trips (25 northbound & 26 southbound)
        Skyline Boulevard to/from north:

                                          July 2, 2012



       -   AM Peak Hour: +36 trips (21 southbound & 15 northbound)
       -   PM School Peak Hour: +24 trips (12 southbound & 12 northbound)

Parking Demand
Based on on-campus parking observations, mid-day vehicle counts, and a review of inbound &
outbound traffic count data collected over a 7-day period:
       Mid-day parking demand, on typical weekdays between the hours of 10:00 AM and 3:00
       PM, was found to be 115 vehicles or less with the exception of "special event" days, based
       on the following:
       -   Mid-day vehicle counts were conducted on Wednesday, April 18, 2012, which found
           that 115 vehicles were parked on campus during both the late-morning and early-
           afternoon time periods. (See Appendix D).
       -   In addition, based on a comparison of "in and out" vehicle counts derived from
           machine traffic counts conducted at the Nueva driveway over a 7-day period from
           April 19-25, 2012 (see Appendix A), the estimated number of cars parked on campus
           between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM on day was estimated and compared with the vehicle
           counts conducted on April 18, 2012. The high end of the range reflects the higher
           number of vehicles parked between 10-11 AM, while the lower end of the range
           reflects the hours between 11 AM and 2 PM:
           o   Wednesday, April 18:observed 115 mid-day vehicles parked on campus
           o   Thursday, April 19: estimated 75 to 102 mid-day vehicles parked on campus
           o   Friday, April 20: estimated 105 to 113 mid-day vehicles parked on campus
           o   Monday, April 23: estimated 102 to 109 mid-day vehicles parked on campus
           o   Tuesday, April 24: estimated 127 to 165 mid-day vehicles parked on campus for
               special event
           o   Wednesday, April 25: estimated 102 to 109 mid-day vehicles parked on campus
       Therefore, based on the typical weekday mid-day parking occupancy counts, the existing
       mid-day parking demand is 115 vehicles or less during typical mid-day hours.
       -   Based on that current rate of typical mid-day parking demand: the future mid-day
           parking demand would increase to approximately 143 vehicles parked on campus
           based on a 25 percent increase over existing conditions
       Peak parking demand for special events, based on the late-morning demand during a
       special event observed on-campus in April would generate additional demand and
       require special accommodations. Special event parking could utilize portions of the loop
       road and/or athletic fields for temporary parking. In addition, the use of stacked or "valet
       parking" could increase the parking supply within on-campus lots by as much as 50
       percent.
       -   During the special event that was held on Tuesday, April 24, 2012, the number of
           vehicles parked during the hour between 10 AM and 11 AM is estimated to be 165
           vehicles (based on the net "in" and "out" traffic volumes during that time period.
           Therefore, the volume of vehicles during the special event exceeded the typical
           weekday mid-day parking demand by 50 vehicles.

Methodology
Nelson\Nygaard initiated traffic volume and parking demand counts, and conducted site
observations, focusing on:
       ·     Campus access:
                  o    Vehicle queues approaching the campus entrance
                  o    Non-vehicle access to campus (bicycle, pedestrian, transit)
       ·     Internal circulation, including observations of:
                  o    Vehicle circulation to/from student drop-off/pick-up area and to/from on-
                       campus parking facilities
                  o    Shuttle bus loading
                  o    Pedestrian circulation within campus
                  o    Bicycle circulation within campus
                  o    Parking supply and demand
       ·     On-campus data collection
                  o    Motor vehicle traffic volumes
                                  Daily traffic volumes entering and exiting The Nueva School were
                                  determined based on machine counts conducted at the campus entrance
                                  over a 7-day period from April 19-25, 2012
                                  The distribution of northbound and southbound traffic was determined
                                  based on peak period turning movement counts conducted at the
                                  intersection of Skyline Boulevard/Nueva School Entrance on Wednesday,
                                  April 18, 2012
                  o    Parking demand
                                  Mid-day parking demand was determined based on parking occupancy
                                  counts, conducted within the Nueva School campus between the hours of
                                  9:30 AM and 2:30 PM on Wednesday, April 17, 2012
       ·     Off-campus data collection
                  o    Motor vehicle traffic volumes
                                  Daily traffic volumes on Skyline Boulevard (classified as a "Minor
                                  Arterial" street by the Hillsborough General Plan1) were determined
                                  based on machine counts conducted on the segment between the Nueva
                                  School Entrance and Rowan Tree Lane on Thursday, May 10, 2012, as
                                  well as a comparison with older data contained in the Hillsborough
                                  General Plan
                                  Peak Hour traffic volumes were determined based on turning movement
                                  counts conducted between 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, and 2:30 PM to 6:00
                                  PM, at the following intersections on Thursday, May 10, 2012:
                                        1.   Skyline Boulevard / Nueva School Entrance
                                        2. Skyline Boulevard / Trousdale Avenue

This information was utilized in determining the current rate of traffic generation, distribution of
traffic to the north and south of campus, and parking demand.

Traffic Volumes & Trip Distribution
Nueva School Vehicle Trips
Trip generation rates were determined on a "per student population2" basis for Nueva School
based on AM and PM peak turning movements conducted at the intersection of Skyline Boulevard
with the Nueva School driveway (see Appendix C for peak-period turning movement count
sheets), and Daily traffic counts at the campus entrance over a 7-day period (see Appendix A for
daily traffic count sheets summarizing data collected from April 18-24, 2012) which found that:
     ·     Two-thirds of campus trips are to/from the south, while one-third of campus
           trips are to/from the north
     ·     During the AM Peak Hour (8:00 to 9:00 am), 420 vehicle trips were
           generated (244 inbound and 176 outbound)
                 o    Vehicle Trip Rate per Student (based on current population of 400 students):
                      1.05 AM Peak Hour vehicle trips per student population (total of inbound &
                      outbound)
                 o    58% inbound / 42% outbound during AM Peak Hour
     ·     During the PM Peak Hour for school traffic (which occurred from 3:00 to
           4:00 pm, earlier than the typical PM Peak Hour), 299 vehicle trips were
           generated (145 inbound and 154 outbound)
                 o    Vehicle Trip Rate per Student (based on current population of 400 students):
                      0.75 PM School Peak Hour vehicle trips per student population (total of inbound
                      & outbound)
                 o    48% inbound / 52% outbound during School PM Peak Hour
     ·     Daily weekday traffic varied, between 1,300 to 1,500 daily vehicle trips
           generated by Nueva School (total inbound and outbound) during the week of
           April 18-25, 2012:
                 o    Peak weekday traffic: 1,512 daily vehicle trips (rate of 3.78 vehicle trips per
                      student population)
                                  Based on 24-hour traffic volumes on Tuesday, April 24, 2012
                 o    Average weekday traffic: 1,396 daily vehicle trips (rate of 3.49 vehicle trips per
                      student population)



2 Employee trips are included in the AM, PM, and Daily traffic volumes, but for trip generation purposes: the "rate" of trip generation

is described on a "per student population" basis.

As described in the following section:
    ·   Existing Traffic Volume on Skyline Blvd: The segment of Skyline Boulevard
        (immediately south of the Nueva School driveway) carries approximately 4,500 daily
        vehicle trips (including trips generated by Nueva School). Therefore, traffic generated by
        Nueva School represents up to one-third of daily traffic on this segment of Skyline
        Boulevard.
    ·   Traffic Capacity on Skyline Blvd: Based on the Hillsborough General Plan,

Forecast of Vehicle Trip Distribution with Campus Master Plan
The anticipated distribution of net new campus vehicle trips is shown on Figure 6 below, based on
the projected increase of campus population with buildout of the campus master plan, to
accommodate up to 500 total students (net increase of 100 new students).
The trip distribution forecast was derived from the existing traffic pattern (as shown on Figure 4
above), applied to the anticipated growth in student population (net increase of 100 students).

Off-Campus Traffic Volumes
24-hour traffic counts were conducted on Skyline Boulevard (just south of the campus entrance)
as shown in Appendix B.
Peak period turning movement counts were conducted at five off-campus intersections, as shown
in Appendix C.
Traffic counts findings and related observations are summarized below:
        Skyline Boulevard / Nueva School Entrance (stop-sign controlled
        intersection)
        -   No traffic delays were observed on Skyline Boulevard, for vehicle trips heading
            inbound to campus
        -   Internal delays were observed related to outbound trips from Nueva School, exiting to
            the south (i.e., westbound left-turn from Nueva School to Skyline Boulevard
            southbound)


        Skyline Boulevard / Trousdale Avenue (stop-sign controlled intersection)
        -   Provides access to I-280 northbound, and serves up to one-third of campus trips:

             Skyline Boulevard / Chateau Drive (stop-sign controlled intersection)
             -    Majority of traffic is limited to north/south through movements (with relatively low
                  side-street volumes via Chateau Drive)

             -    Town of Hillsborough has determined by adopted policy that level of service (LOS) F
                  is allowable at this intersection3. As stated in the General Plan Circulation Element

                       regional traffic traveling to and from I-280 though Hillsborough. (General
                       Plan Circulation Element, Page C-15)
                  o    "The Town has decided that, while some improvements are necessary to ensure
                       the comfort of its residents traveling through the Black Mountain Road/Hayne
                       Road/Skyline Boulevard intersection and to Nueva School, the Town cannot
                       afford to make costly circulation improvements simply to facilitate regional
                       traffic..." (General Plan Circulation Element, Page C-7).
                  o    "While accepting a higher level of congestion, the Town will work with San
                       Mateo County and Caltrans to implement feasible improvements at this
                       location, such as adding a separate eastbound left-turn lane and a separate
                       shared through/right-turn lane to improve traffic flow." (General Plan

        -   Anticipated growth in traffic at this location, resulting from Nueva School expansion,
            is forecasted as follows (based on net increase of up to 69 AM and 51 PM Peak Hour
            trips, total of inbound & outbound traffic, as summarized on Figure 6):
            o   Inbound trips (to Nueva School): 40 AM Peak Hour, 25 PM Peak Hour
                ·   This corresponds to an average of up to one additional vehicle exiting the
                    freeway every 90 seconds over the course of the peak hour. During the "peak
                    15 minutes", this would increase to up to one additional vehicle exiting the
                    freeway every 30 to 60 seconds.
            o   Outbound trips (from Nueva School): 29 AM Peak Hour, 26 PM Peak Hour
                ·   Less than 0.5 added vehicle trips per minute outbound during peak hours
Key observations are that:

        Daily traffic on Skyline Boulevard consists of approximately 4,500 vehicles (total 2-way
        traffic volume);

        -   Therefore, Nueva School traffic consists of approximately one-third of daily traffic on
            the portion of Skyline Boulevard near campus

        -   As described in the Hillsborough General Plan: Skyline Boulevard can accommodate
            up to 8,800 daily vehicle trips while maintaining the Town's LOS standard of C for
            the roadway segment (see page C-5 of General Plan Circulation Element, provided in
            Appendix F).

        -   The anticipated increase in daily traffic resulting from Nueva School expansion would
            be less than 400 daily vehicle trips (as summarized on Figure 6), representing an
            increase of less than 10 percent compared to existing volumes.


        Based on observations of vehicle delay and the intersection turning movement count
        data: unacceptable LOS is not anticipated to result from the additional campus traffic that
        would result from buildout of the Nueva School expansion.

Mid-day Parking Demand
Existing Mid-day Parking Demand
The assessment of existing parking demand in on-campus parking lots focused on mid-day
conditions (between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm), excluding the peak drop-off/pick-up periods as
described above.
Mid-day parking demand was observed based on on-campus parking occupancy counts
conducted on Wednesday, April 18, 2012 which found that:
   ·   115 parking spaces were occupied during both the late morning (approximately 10:00 am)
       and early afternoon (after 1:00 pm) time periods
   ·   The observed rate of mid-day parking demand equates to:
           o   0.28 vehicles parked per student population (based on current population of 400
               students); or
           o   1.15 vehicles parked per employee population (based on approximately 100
               employees)
Future Mid-day Parking Demand
Future parking demand was estimated based on the current rate of mid-day parking occupancy
(described above).
Based on the observed mid-day parking demand: the proposed increase in student population
(from 400 to 500 students) would generate additional parking demand of:
   ·   Net increase of approximately 28 added vehicles parked during mid-day hours (based on
       proposed increase in student population of 100 additional students)
   ·   Total parking demand of 143 mid-day vehicles parked at build-out of the campus master
       plan.
           o   The recommended provision of on-campus parking spaces (to serve 143 mid-day
               vehicles) would be 157 parking spaces, to serve anticipated mid-day parking
               demand and provide a 10 percent vacancy factor.

On-Campus Observations
Nelson\Nygaard observed parents dr0pping off and picking up students during the morning of
Tuesday 4/25 and afternoon of Wednesday 4/26. Observations conducted on the morning of
4/25 coincided with a special event on-campus, in which traffic volumes and parking demand
exceeded typical weekday conditions by a significant amount.
Pick-up and drop-off activity peaked between 8:15 ­ 8:30 am in the morning and 3:25 ­ 3:40 pm
in the afternoon.

roadside. The staff lot (below the Crocker mansion) was about 50% occupied. The on-street
parking on the north side of the upper loop was fully occupied. In addition, there were several
"creatively" parked vehicles throughout campus.
There was a guest speaker on Tuesday morning, to which 75 parents had rsvp'd. This may explain
the very high parking occupancy observed.



Constraints
        In the morning a
        significant number of
        parents dropped their
        children off in the south
        lot, or parked their and
        walked with their
        children to school. The
        only occasions where          Ad-hoc parking on the lower loop

        vehicles backed up
        towards the entrance were at the very peak when up to 6 vehicles were observed waiting
        while parents and children crossed the road at the entrance to the lower loop.
        In the afternoon parents' vehicles enter campus and queue in the south lot, awaiting their
        turn to access the curbside pickup lane. At peak, the queue extended from the south lot
        exit (on the loop road) to the water main at Skyline, a distance of some 250 feet (some 12-
        15 vehicles).


        Parents parking outside
        designated areas to wait
        for their children, for
        example on the very
        steep ramp into the
        teachers' parking lot
        behind the
        administration building.

        administration building, a distance of approximately 670 feet (approx 33 vehicles). The
        cause seemed to be vehicles waiting to turn left onto Skyline ­ it only takes a handful of
        vehicles waiting to turn left in order for vehicles turning right being stuck in the loop road
        due to the short length of the driveway.

          Several vehicles were parked on the loop during the peak, which causes delays. Teachers
          put notes on these vehicles indicating "No Parking 2:45 ­ 3:45 pm".
          Four school buses were observed that serve the school, two smaller buses and two full size
          school buses. The larger buses took about 5 minutes to unload, during which time there
          was some queuing in the adjacent drop-off lane.
          The buses utilize slightly more curb space than might be assumed ­ the buses stopped
          several car lengths behind any vehicle in front in order to leave room so they could pull
          out.



Potential Operational Improvement Options
          If parents waiting to pick up in the afternoons were instructed to pull forward when
          possible, instead of waiting in one spot, then the entire available length from admissions
          building to administration building would be utilized more effectively.
          Outbound queuing at the exit could be reduced if only right turns were permitted. The
          trade off would be that parents then have to make a u-turn on Skyline, or drive a different
          route ­ hence this option is not recommended since two-thirds of campus trips are
          to/from the south.
          Require parents to circle until they see their child(ren), instead of parking on the loop
          with a queue through the south lot. This strategy is commonly used at airports and is
          efficient, but the downside is additional vehicle miles traveled. However, unnecessary
          vehicle movements should be minimized in a school setting.

3   CIRCULATION ELEMENT




    The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide the policy framework for
    regulation and development of the circulation system in Hillsborough. This Ele-
    ment balances the need to provide safe ways to move people from one place to an-
    other with the goal of preserving the character of the community.

    The Circulation Element must be correlated with the Land Use Element. As
    required by Government Code Section 65302(b), this Element contains in-
    formation on the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
    thoroughfares, transportation routes and terminals. State law also requires
    that a Circulation Element include data and policies related to the provision
    of public infrastructure. These components have been moved to the Land
    Use Element.

    The Element is divided into two sections:

      Background Information. Provides background information on the ex-
      isting circulation system, as well as identifies improvements that will be
      made to address existing problem areas.

      Goals, Policies and Actions. Provides policy guidance for maintaining
      and improving all aspects of the circulation system.



    A. Background Information

    The Town of Hillsborough is a unique community in that its founders made
    the decision to preserve the low density character of the community by
    adopting regulations that banned sidewalks and grid pattern streets. As a re-
    sult, Hillsborough is mainly comprised of small, curvilinear residential
    streets, with few direct cross-town connections or connections to the external
    regional roadway system. The following provides some general information
    about the regional system that serves Hillsborough and surrounding communi-
    ties, as well as the local system, which was designed primarily for local residents.




                                                                                    C-1

1. Regional Roadway System
Regional access to Hillsborough is provided by three major freeways: State
Route 92 (SR 92), U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) and Interstate 280 (I-280). El
Camino Real (SR 82) also serves regional traffic and links Hillsborough to the
cities of Burlingame and San Mateo. Brief descriptions of these key regional
roadways within the Town are presented below.

The portion of SR 92 adjacent to Hillsborough is a freeway that runs in an
east-west direction from Half Moon Bay, near the coast, to Hayward on the
east side of the San Francisco Bay via the San Mateo Bridge. SR 92 has two
lanes in each direction between I-280 and US 101. Access to Hillsborough via
SR 92 is provided via interchanges at Ralston Avenue/Polhemus Road, De
Anza, Alameda De Las Pulgas and El Camino Real.

US 101 is an eight-lane freeway located east of the Town of Hillsborough.
US 101 extends northwards to San Francisco and southwards to San Jose and
the Central California Coast. Access to US 101 is provided via several routes
along local roadways in Hillsborough, San Mateo and Burlingame.

I-280 is a north-south freeway located to the west of Town. I-280 runs be-
tween San Jose and San Francisco and contains four lanes in each direction
near Hillsborough. The portion of I-280 adjacent to Hillsborough is an offi-
cially designated State Scenic Highway. Direct access to the Town of Hills-
borough is provided via the Black Mountain Road/Hayne Road/Skyline
Boulevard interchange. Indirect access to the Town is provided at the Trous-
dale Drive interchange (via Skyline Boulevard) and at the Bunker Hill Drive
interchange (via Polhemus Road).

El Camino Real (SR 82) is an arterial extending between San Francisco to the
north and San Jose to the south. The number of lanes on El Camino Real
varies from one community to another. In the vicinity of Floribunda Ave-
nue, four lanes are provided on El Camino Real.

2. Local Street Classification System
The local roadway system serving Hillsborough is mainly comprised of
smaller, curved residential streets. The following provides a description of
the functional classifications of the local roadways serving Hillsborough, and
also identifies which streets in Hillsborough are within each classification.
These roadways work together to form the Town's major circulation system.

  Freeways. Freeways are limited-access, high-speed travelways included in
  the State and federal highway systems. Their purpose is to carry long-
  distance regional traffic. Access is provided by interchanges with typical
  spacings of one-mile or greater. No direct access is provided to adjacent
  land uses. There are no freeways within the Town's limits. Interstate
  280 is located to the west of the Town, State Route 92 is located to the
  south and US 101 is located to the east of Hillsborough.

  Arterials. Arterial roadways are major streets that primarily serve
  through-traffic and provide access to abutting properties as a secondary
  function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six travel lanes and
  major cross-street intersections are signalized. This roadway type is di-
  vided into two categories: major and minor arterials. Major arterials are
  typically four- or more lane roadways and serve both local and through
  traffic. El Camino Real is Hillsborough's only major arterial. Minor ar-
  terials are typically two- to four-lane streets and serve local and commute
  traffic. Minor arterials within Hillsborough include Crystal Springs
  Road and Skyline Boulevard.

  Collectors. Collectors are streets that provide land access and traffic cir-
  culation within residential areas. They connect local streets to arterials
  and are typically designed with two travel lanes. Examples of collectors
  in Hillsborough include El Cerrito Avenue, Hayne Road, Black Moun-
  tain Road, Chateau Drive, Ralston Avenue and Hillsborough Boulevard.

  Local Streets. Local streets provide direct access to abutting residential
  properties as their primary function. In Hillsborough, the majority of
  streets are local streets.

3. Level of Service Definitions
The operations of roadway facilities are described with a "level of service" or
"LOS", which is a qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors
as speed, travel time, delay and freedom to maneuver. Six levels are defined
from LOS A, the best operating conditions, to LOS F, or the worst operating
conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. When volumes ex-
ceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result and operations are designated as
LOS F.

Table C-1 depicts the threshold volumes, based on the roadway facility type
and number of lanes, for the various types of roadways found in the Town.
These threshold volumes are approximate in nature and serve primarily as a
general guide as to whether the roadway is over or under capacity. Where
intersections become the constraint points along roadway segments, the inter-
section's level of service can be used to determine the roadway's level of ser-
vice. Signalized and unsignalized intersections level of service are based on
the delay that drivers experience when passing through an intersection. Ta-
bles C-2 and C-3 depict the level of service levels for signalized and unsignal-
ized intersections.

4. Circulation Problem Areas and Solutions
Overall, Hillsborough's roadway system operates at a LOS A or B the major-
ity of the time. As local and regional growth continue to occur during the
next 20 years, the roadways volumes may increase to a LOS C operation on
Ralston Avenue, but the majority of the roadways will still maintain LOS A
or B operations, assuming a growth rate of approximately one percent per
year.

While the existing and future roadway operations will be generally at good
levels of service, limited problems will occur in the Town. The following
actions outline the issues and concerns raised in the community with regards
to traffic circulation in the Town, as well as describe how the Town will ad-
dress each issue.

a. School Congestion
There are existing problems with congestion occurring around the public
schools during the morning when students are dropped-off and in the after-
noon when they are picked-up. High levels of congestion only occur for a
period of less than one hour twice a day. For example, the intersections near
Crocker Middle and North Elementary Schools operate at a LOS D occurring
during the morning drop-off period and LOS C in the afternoon. This will
continue to decline in the future, with mornings worsening to LOS F and
afternoon falling to LOS D. Installing major physical traffic control im-
provements, such as traffic signals or additional waiting areas for cars, to im-
prove the traffic flow during these short periods of time would be very costly
and affect the visual character of the area. As a result, the Town is willing to
accept a higher level of congestion around the public schools during the pick-
up and drop-off hours then it would otherwise accept on other residential
roadways.

However, the Town will continue to work with the School District to ex-
plore less intrusive and less costly ways to control congestion and traffic flow

                                                           G E N E R A L P L A N

around the public schools. For example, the Hillsborough City School Dis-
trict is in the process of creating a Master Plan of improvements for all of the
public schools. The School District has hired traffic consultants to help redes-
ign school access as part of the Master Plan process. Since many of these im-
provements will not occur for several years, the Town will consider short-
term measures, such as additional police presence, to help manage school traf-
fic.

b. Floribunda Avenue/El Camino Real Intersection Safety
There are approximately seven to eight traffic accidents per month within
Hillsborough and the highest number occur at the intersection of Floribunda
Avenue and El Camino Real. A study of the intersection was completed and
potential improvements identified that address the intersection's various
safety concerns. The Town will work with Caltrans to implement the
study's recommendations.

c. Black Mountain Road/Hayne Road/Skyline Boulevard Intersection
Another area that experiences high levels of congestion is the Black Mountain
Road/Hayne Road/Skyline Boulevard intersection, with a morning LOS E.
While much of this traffic is comprised of local Hillsborough residents, con-
tractors and students traveling to The Nueva School, people traveling to and
from San Mateo and other adjacent communities also use Hayne Road to ac-
cess I-280. A portion of the intersection is outside of the Town's limits and
under the jurisdiction of San Mateo County and Caltrans.

Future regional growth projections from the City/County Association of
Governments (C/CAG) regional travel demand forecasting model anticipate
that the number of non-Hillsborough residents impacting the intersection
will increase dramatically in the future, reaching a LOS F both in the morn-
ing and afternoon. The Town has decided that, while some improvements
are necessary to ensure the comfort of its residents traveling through the
Black Mountain Road/Hayne Road/Skyline Boulevard intersection and to
The Nueva School, the Town cannot afford to make costly circulation im-
provements simply to facilitate regional traffic, especially since the Hillsbor-




                                                                               C-7
T O W N O F H I L L S B O R O U G H

C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




ough circulation system was never designed to safety transport large numbers
of through vehicles. As a result, the acceptable level of service for this inter-
section is higher than the rest of the community.

While accepting a higher level of congestion, the Town will work with San
Mateo County and Caltrans to implement feasible improvements at this loca-
tion, such as adding a separate eastbound left-turn lane and a separate shared
through/right-turn lane to improve traffic flow. This improvement is antici-
pated to improve the intersection's operation to LOS D in the morning and
LOS C in the afternoon.

d. On-street Parking Obstructions
Many of Hillsborough's streets are narrow and vehicles are often not parked
properly. Fire engines sometimes have difficulty navigating around parked
vehicles on streets. Residents are usually responsive when asked to fix the
situation. The Town will update its parking strip requirements to ensure that
there is adequate on-street parking and provide safer pedestrian routes, while
addressing concerns about the impact of parking strips on the visual character
of the community.

e. Emergency Response Access
The existing circulation system increases the difficulty for the Fire Depart-
ment to serve the Town due to the limited number of north-south connec-
tions. This lack of connectivity limits the options for responding vehicles.
There are few physical improvements that can made to the circulation system
to address this since the roadway system is mainly built-out. However, to
address this issue, the Fire Department ensures that its drivers are well trained
and know the Town well.

5. Parking Requirements
Parking generally is not a problem in Hillsborough, since most homes pro-
vide adequate off-street parking for residents and a limited number of guests.
When parking may become an issue is during large events, such as parties,
when there is a high demand for on-street parking. This can become a prob-




C-8

                                                            G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                 C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




lem since the Town's streets are generally narrow, and poorly parked cars can
make through traffic and emergency access difficult. The police are available
to assist in organizing parking during events, and they report that generally
people are very responsive when asked to park correctly.

To address the need for on-street parking that allows cars to be parked par-
tially out of the roadway, the Town requires development that involves work
within a public right-of-way, or when a building permit is issued involving
more than 50 percent of the living area of a dwelling, to provide a 5-foot-wide
parking strip along the street frontage of the property. Some members of the
community find the parking strips unattractive. Another complaint is that
some property owners install parking strips, but then put vegetation or hard-
scape within the parking strips, making them unusable for parking. Another
parking issue raised is that some visitors are not aware that the strips are to be
used for parking. To address these issues and ensure that the parking strip
ordinance meets the needs of the community, the Town will update the ordi-
nance, as described in the Goals, Policies and Actions section of this Element.

6. Pedestrian Routes
The Town of Hillsborough has a history of not allowing sidewalks in an ef-
fort to maintain the rural character of the community. While the lack of
sidewalks does add to the character of the community, it sometimes results in
people having to walk in the travel lanes of the roadway, potentially creating
safety hazards, especially for children walking to school. The parking strips
do provide an alternative to walking on the street, when not used by cars.
The revision to the parking strip ordinance, as discussed in the Goals, Policies
and Actions section, will take into consideration the benefits to pedestrian
safety when determining the appropriate location for parking strips. The
Town will also encourage the provision of bicycle and pedestrian routes
around school areas to encourage students to walk and bike to school and
help reduce automobile congestion.




                                                                                C-9

The San Mateo County 2001 Trails Plan identifies two trails that are routed
through Hillsborough or adjacent to the Town limits.

  First, the multi-use San Mateo Creek Trail is proposed along Crystal
  Springs Road, with a proposed on-street bicycle route and off-street path
  for hikers. The Town supports exploring the possibility of completing
  the San Mateo Creek Trail, with an emphasis on providing an off-street
  trail for both pedestrian and bicyclists due to the narrow roadway which
  makes on-street bicycle travel dangerous.

  Second, El Camino Real is identified as the hiking/equestrian Juan
  Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail due to the fact that the road
  generally follows the route taken by Juan Bautista de Anza in 1775-6.
  However, the Trails Plan states that El Camino Real is not the best loca-
  tion for recreational use due to the high volume of traffic and recom-
  mends using other trails. Alternatives to this route, using other trails
  outside Hillsborough, are identified in the Trails Plan.

7. Bicycle Facilities
Bike facilities are limited in Hillsborough due to the existing narrow roadway
system and hilly terrain. Consistent with the proposed San Mateo Creek
Trail identified in the County's Trail Plan, as described above, portions of
Crystal Springs Road contain existing bicycle lanes. Bicycle lanes are striped
along the south side of Crystal Springs Road from Stonebridge to El Cerrito
and then for a short portion further to the west on both sides of Crystal
Springs. However, the bike lane is not complete and is very narrow in areas,
thereby making it difficult to access and use. There is also an existing bike
lane along both sides of Skyline Boulevard from Hayne Road to Summit
Drive. The 2000 San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Route Plan also
shows bikeways for both Skyline Boulevard and Crystal Springs Road. The
proposed Crystal Springs bikeway, called Crystal Springs--3rd/4th Avenue
Bikeway, would connect the multi-use Sawyer Camp Trail, located in San
Mateo County west of the Town of Hillsborough, to the San Francisco Bay
Trail multi-use path that traverses the shorelines of the cities to the east of
Hillsborough. The Town will continue to explore opportunities to provide

additional bicycle facilities, where appropriate. Figure C-1 depicts the loca-
tion of the existing Skyline Boulevard and proposed Crystal Springs Road
bikeways.

Even though there are few official bicycle facilities in Hillsborough, the Bicy-
cle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee of C/CAG has identified main bicy-
cle routes for Hillsborough. These maps are available to the public for use in
planning their bicycle trip through Hillsborough.

8. Public Transit
There is not currently any public transportation running through the Town
of Hillsborough. Due to Hillsborough's low density housing, low ridership
potential, and roadway system, it is unlikely that any fixed bus route would
be routed through the Town.

Express bus route #MX, operated by the San Mateo County Transit District
(SamTrans), runs along El Camino Real, providing service to downtown San
Francisco. Riders of the #MX route can transfer to Routes 295, 390 and 391,
which run to the Caltrain station, South San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Tran-
sit (BART) station and Colma BART station, respectively. Residents of Hills-
borough have access to the BART system at the Millbrae BART station,
which is the closest station and is located in the neighboring City of Millbrae.

SamTrans also offers Redi-Wheels, a Paratransit service for the disabled per-
sons of Bayside San Mateo County who are unable to use regular bus services.
This service is available for disabled residents of Hillsborough. The Redi-
Wheels territory includes San Mateo County and also transports riders to
North Palo Alto and portions of San Francisco.

Regional rail service is provided in the adjacent communities of Millbrae, Bur-
lingame and San Mateo. Caltrain provides frequent train service between San
Jose and San Francisco seven days a week, with the "Baby Bullet" train stop-
ping at the Millbrae station. During commute hours, Caltrain provides




                                                                              C-11

Hillsborough are the Millbrae, Broadway, Burlingame and San Mateo sta-
tions.

9. San Francisco International and San Carlos Airports
The closest airport to Hillsborough is the San Francisco International Airport
(SFO). SFO is located approximately three miles northeast of Hillsborough
on the northeast side of US 101, between the freeway and the San Francisco
Bay. The facility is the largest commercial service airport in the Bay Area and
in Northern California. The airport is served by 38 airlines and served ap-
proximately 29 million annual passengers in 2003. The airport is owned and
operated by the City and County of San Francisco, but is located entirely
within San Mateo County.

San Carlos Airport is located approximately 10 miles southeast of SFO adja-
cent to US 101, on the northeast side of the freeway. San Carlos Airport is a
small but busy general aviation airport. The facility is located within the city
limits of the City of San Carlos, but is owned and operated by the County of
San Mateo. The facility includes a single runway (Runway 12/30) that is
2,600 feet in length. Aircraft operating at the airport are limited by the
County of San Mateo to 12,500 pounds or less in weight. This limitation
allows most single piston engine aircraft and some light twin piston engine
aircraft. Approximately 500 general aviation aircraft are based at the airport.
The facility is designed for general aviation aircraft operations (take-offs, land-
ings and transitions) only, with the airport handling approximately 170,000
operations per year. There is no current or planned commercial airline ser-
vice at San Carlos Airport.

B. Goals, Policies and Actions




Goal C-1        Provide for well-maintained, safe roads and encour-
                age safe driving, bicycling and walking practices
                throughout the Town.

Policy C-1.1:   Maintain public roadways in good condition to minimize
                the potential for automobile accidents and reduce wear and
                tear on vehicles.

Policy C-1.2:   Install additional street safety improvements, where feasible,
                within areas where traffic creates public safety problems.

Policy C-1.3:   Provide for adequate sight distance at all intersections and
                driveways where feasible, including areas experiencing high
                parking rates due to construction projects and events.

Policy C-1.4:   Promote safe motor vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle activities
                to avoid situations that may result in accidents.

Policy C-1.5:   Maintain adequate emergency access for all land uses.

Action C-1.1:   The Public Works Department will continue to utilize the
                Pavement Management System to plan for the on-going
                maintenance of the Town's roadways.

Action C-1.2:   The Police Department will monitor accident reports and
                complaints to identify locations that are at high risk for ac-
                cidents, including the El Camino Real/Floribunda Avenue
                intersection. They will work with the Public Works De-

                                             C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




Goal C-2        Wherever possible, reduce traffic congestion in
                Hillsborough, especially around schools and at
                main entrances to Hillsborough.

Policy C-2.1:   Maintain a minimum Level of Service "C" operating stan-
                dard for intersections and roadway segments in the Town of
                Hillsborough, except for the Black Mountain Road/Hayne
                Road/Skyline Boulevard intersection and the intersections
                and roadway segments adjacent to public or private schools.

Policy C-2.2:   Accept Level of Service "F" at the intersection of Black
                Mountain Road/Hayne Road/Skyline Boulevard, which is
                affected by regional traffic traveling to and from I-280
                through Hillsborough.

Policy C-2.3:   Accept Level of Service "F" during the morning and after-
                noon pick-up and drop-off hours at intersections and road-
                way segments adjacent to the public schools due to the in-
                termittent character of the congestion.

Policy C-2.4:   Work with the public and private schools to encourage site
                design and operation that reduce, wherever possible, traffic
                impacts to adjacent roadways.

Policy C-2.5:   Encourage the public and private schools to expand ride-
                sharing activities to help reduce school-generated vehicle
                traffic around the schools.

Policy C-2.6:   Coordinate with adjacent jurisdictions and regional planning
                agencies to promote safe and efficient roadway design at
                Town entrances, as well as to support the management of
                overall traffic congestion.




                                                                           C-15

C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




Action C-2.1:   The Town will work with San Mateo County, the SFPUC
                and Caltrans to implement feasible improvements at the in-
                tersection of Black Mountain Road/Hayne Road/Skyline
                Boulevard to improve traffic flow or limit the amount of re-
                gional cut-through traffic traveling into the Town. Such
                improvements might include adding a separate eastbound
                left-turn lane and a separate shared through/right-turn lane.
                The Town may consider adoption of traffic impact fees to
                fund the Town's share of improvements.

Action C-2.2:   The Town will work with Hillsborough City School Dis-
                trict through the District's Facility Master Plan process to
                identify roadway improvements for site access and on-site
                circulation at the schools, as well as explore and implement
                traffic control programs to reduce congestion in the area
                around the public schools. The Town will also work with
                the District to identify and implement short-term measures,
                such as providing additional police presence, to address traf-
                fic congestion until long-term improvements are made.

Action C-2.3:   The Town will work with the School District and local pri-
                vate schools to develop a network for parents to facilitate
                organizing carpools as well as encouraging safe walking and
                biking.

Action C-2.4:   The Town will identify minimum Levels of Service for in-
                tersections and roadways shared with adjacent communities
                (i.e. the intersection of El Camino Real/Floribunda Avenue
                and the roadway segments of Summit Drive east of Bella
                Vista Drive and of Crystal Springs Road west of Alameda de
                las Pulgas) and pursue agreements with adjacent communi-
                ties to maintain those intersections at the agreed upon Level
                of Service.

Action C-2.5:   While accepting a lower Level of Service where appropriate,
                the Town will monitor every five years via traffic counts
                roadway segments or intersections that are operating at
                Level of Service D or lower. The Town will explore feasible
                mitigation measures to reduce congestion at these locations.




Goal C-3        Ensure that there is adequate, safe parking to main-
                tain good traffic flow and emergency access.

Policy C-3.1:   Encourage property owners to provide adequate parking to
                meet demand.

Policy C-3.2:   Continue to require property owners who are building a
                new house or remodeling/adding more than 50 percent to
                the living area of an existing house, to install parking strips,
                as a means to provide safer on-street parking. Once up-
                dated, parking strip requirements will reflect the need to
                continue to require parking strips in areas where the strips
                provide needed parking and safety, such as:

                 Narrow streets where on-street parking without a parking
                 strip may obstruct the flow of traffic.

                 Areas near to major pedestrian destinations, such as
                 schools and parks, where parking strips provide off-street
                 pedestrian routes.

                In addition to affirming areas where parking strips should
                continue to be required, the updated parking strip require-
                ment will incorporate additional opportunities for flexibil-
                ity, such as reducing or waiving the parking strip require-
                ments. Opportunities where flexibility may be appropriate
                include:




                                                                             C-17
T O W N O F H I L L S B O R O U G H
G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




                 Non-residential properties where adequate off-street park-
                 ing is available for visitors and where there are little or no
                 adjacent residential uses that will generate the need for
                 parking.

                 Properties located on streets with little demand for park-
                 ing and where parking strips on only a portion of the
                 street frontage will provide adequate opportunities for
                 safe, on-street parking.

Action C-3.1:   The Town will review all construction plans for confor-
                mance with Municipal Code parking requirements.

Action C-3.2:   The Town will update the parking strip requirement.




Goal C-4        Provide for safe pedestrian routes in appropriate
                locations.

Policy C-4.1:   Work with the public and private schools to promote safe
                driving and pedestrian circulation around or near the
                schools.

Policy C-4.2:   Work with residents to identify appropriate locations for
                the provision of off-street pedestrian routes, such as on
                Town-owned open space areas, large properties when subdi-
                vided, and as a feature of parking strips.

Action C-4.1:   The Town will coordinate with the school district and other
                entities to develop "Suggested Routes to School Plans" for
                all public and private schools in the Town. Plans shall iden-
                tify all pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and traffic control
                devices for residents to determine the most appropriate
                travel routes. The plans shall also identify existing ease-
                ments for potential use for off-street pedestrian pathways.

                                              C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T




Goal C-5        Support the provision of safe bicycle routes that
                will reduce conflict with automobile traffic.

Policy C-5.1:   Continue to cooperate with San Mateo County, C/CAG
                and bicycle organizations in the planning and implementa-
                tion of a countywide bicycle system which will traverse and
                connect with Hillsborough.

Policy C-5.2:   Encourage the provision of bicycle facilities in areas that
                provide adequate space and separation from automobiles
                without negatively impacting biologically sensitive areas.

Action C-5.1:   The Town will pursue the creation of an off-street bicycle
                trail along Crystal Springs Road, consistent with the
                County's Trails Plan and Bicycle Route Plan. In this effort,
                the Town will work with current property owners, includ-
                ing the SFPUC, to incorporate the trail into future devel-
                opment along the route. The Town will recommend that
                the County of San Mateo research, identify and compete for
                available funding to assist with the completion of the trail.
                Hillsborough will also request the County of San Mateo and
                C/CAG to study feasible alignments that would avoid nega-
                tively impacting sensitive biological resources located along
                San Mateo Creek.

Action C-5.2:   The Town will develop a community awareness program to
                encourage local use of safer bicycle routes, including refer-
                ring residents to the C/CAG Bicycle and Pedestrian Advi-
                sory Committee's bicycle route map. The Town will in-
                clude bicycle and pedestrian safety and enforcement when
                developing community awareness programs.

INTRODUCTION

This environmental noise study for The Nueva School in Hillsborough, California, summarizes our
acoustical measurements and analysis. We also compare our results with the Walsh Norris & Associates,
Inc. environmental noise study conducted for the School in 1996.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Existing Conditions

    Campus noise levels have not changed significantly from the 1996 environmental noise study.
    Campus noise levels do not exceed thresholds set by the Hillsborough Municipal Code and the
    Hillsborough General Plan ­ Noise Element.
    Aircraft flyovers and highway traffic are the dominant noise sources on campus.

Future Conditions

    We predict that a twenty-five percent increase in student and staff population as well as twenty-five
    percent increase in campus vehicular traffic will result in a one-decibel increase in school-generated
    noise. A one-decibel increase in school-generated noise will not significantly affect the noise
    environment due to high ambient noise levels caused by aircraft and highway traffic.

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE

Our sound survey extended from 18 through 24 May 2012 and captures both weekend (19 and 20 May
2012) and weekday (21 through 22 May 2012) school-related noise. It should be noted that three non-
consecutive days were measured as suggested by the Town of Hillsborough. We measured at three
different locations to capture the noise environment of the entire campus. Samples of existing noise were
recorded every fifteen minutes over the entire measurement period except 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on 22
May 2012 when we serviced the measuring devices. Our measurement procedure expands on the 1996
environmental noise study.

The measurement locations are described in Table 1 below and shown on a site map in Figure 1.

On 22 May 2012, we conducted additional noise measurements during lunch periods and at locations
where students played outside (PE on the Upper Field, children playing on the lower lawn outside the
Crocker Mansion, etc.). The results of these measurements were used for our analysis of existing and
future noise levels.

MEASUREMENT RESULTS

Tables 5A through 5C show the results of our measurements, for each hour, in terms of both A-weighted
sound level1 (dBA) and the statistical distribution of the sound levels 2 (L01, L10, L50, L90, and L99).

Figures 2A through 2C (weekend) and Figures 3A through 3C (weekdays) are 24-hour Time Histories of
the measured sound levels for each location during the weekend and weekdays.

The noise exposure levels at the site have also been determined. The Community Noise Equivalent
Levels3 (CNEL) and the Day-Night Average Sound Levels4 (DNL) are tabulated below for each full day of
measurements. We also calculated noise contours for the site (see Figure 4 which shows the DNL from
Highway 280 traffic and Upper Loop Road.




1 dBA - A-Weighted sound pressure level (or noise level) represents the noisiness or loudness of a sound by weighting the
     amplitudes of various acoustical frequencies to correspond more closely with human hearing. A 10-dB (decibel) increase in
     noise level is perceived to be a doubling of loudness. A-Weighting is specified by the U.S. EPA, OSHA, Caltrans, and others for
     use in noise measurements. All values presented as dB in this report are A-weighted values unless specified otherwise.

2 Ln ­ The sound level in dBA that was equaled or exceeded one percent of the time; L10, L50 and L90 are the levels equaled or
     exceeded 10, 50 and 90 percent of the time, respectively.

3 Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) - A descriptor for the 24-hour A-weighted average noise level. The CNEL concept
     accounts for the increased acoustical sensitivity of people to noise during the evening and nighttime hours. Sound levels during
     the hours from 7 pm to 10 pm are penalized 5 dB; sound levels during the hours from 10 pm to 7 am are penalized 10 dB. A
     10-dB increase in sound level is perceived by people to be a doubling of loudness.

4 Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) - A descriptor established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to describe the
     average day-night level with a penalty applied to noise occurring during the nighttime hours (10 pm - 7 am) to account for the
     increased sensitivity of people during sleeping hours.

NOISE ENVIRONMENT

Aircraft Noise

Aircraft noise is the prominent noise source at Locations 1 and 3 with direct flyovers and flyovers at a
distance. Most of the maximum sound levels 5 (Lmax) at Location 2 are from aircraft flyovers. This noise
source is present throughout each 24-hour period at all three locations. The only period when aircraft is
not the predominant source is typically between 1:00 AM and 4:00 AM daily and is consistent with the
1996 environmental noise study.

Highway Noise

Noise from Interstate 280 is a major contributor to the noise environment at Location 2. The highway is
approximately 150 feet from the School's closest property line and approximately 500 feet from the
School's Gymnasium Community Center. While most of the maximum sound levels are caused by aircraft
at Location 2, the DNL and CNEL are heavily influenced by highway activity. At Location 2, the DNL is
approximately 2 decibels higher than the levels displayed on a DNL contour map from the 1996
environmental noise study which is consistent with typical traffic growth for a twelve-year period.

Weekend Event Noise

Weekend events at the school typically consist of curriculum fairs, set constructions and pre-production
activities, and private/invitational events such as weddings and corporate functions. On Saturday, 19 May
2012, the School hosted The Innovative Teacher Project Roundtable from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. During
this interval, the monitor at Location 3 measured noise from children playing in the courtyard with the
children being most active from 10:00 AM to 11:00AM. The average sound level from 10:00 AM to 11:00
AM was 57 dB. The closest neighboring property is 500 feet away from the children playing. Due to
distance effects, sound levels of the children's voices at the nearest residential property line will be
reduced to approximately 25 dB, which is virtually inaudible.

Wedding event noise at the Crocker Mansion was measured as part of the 1996 environmental noise
study. However, the School no longer hosts commercial weddings. Currently, the School only hosts
private weddings for faculty or alumni twice a year at most.

Typical School Day Noise

Current Conditions

During weekdays, the School activities occur between 8:30 AM and 3:30 PM. Voice levels of children are
evident at all three locations during mid-day, but more so at Locations 1 and 3. Children's voices were
heard more often between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. At Location 1 behind the Crocker Mansion, the loudest
one-hour average sound level from child voices from Monday, 21 May 2012, through Wednesday, 23 May
2012, was approximately 56 dB for all three days. This is the same noise level compared to the 1996
environmental noise study. At Location 3, noise from children playing on the Robert A. Swanson field was
audible, but did not above ambient noise levels.

Future Conditions

We understand the School projects a 25-percent increase in student and staff population and 25-percent
increase of vehicular traffic on campus. We predict that this increase will result in a one-decibel increase
in school-generated noise. We conclude that a one-decibel increase in school-generated noise will not
significantly affect the noise environment around the school due to high ambient noise levels caused by
aircraft and highway traffic.

Storm Drainage Evaluation
 Regulatory Issues

 This report presents a summary of the existing storm drainage conditions, problems observed, and
 solutions proposed. The stormwater strategy was developed according to the principles in the San Mateo
 Countywide Pollution Prevention Program C3 Stormwater Guidelines. The 2012 Master Plan Update
 creates 40,000 square feet of net new building footprint, making this project a C.3 Regulated Project,
 which requires Low Impact Development (LID) treatment measures for stormwater management.
 Potential treatment measures could include infiltration, evapotranspiration, rainwater harvesting and reuse
 or bioretention features such as bioswales or constructed wetlands.

 Current Conditions

 The existing 33.7 acre site is predominantly forested and vegetated, with approximately 84% pervious
 surface. Buildings and paved surfaces account for approximately 5.4 acres, or 16% of the site. Rainwater
 runoff from roofs, parking lots and graded areas is collected with storm drain infrastructure

 The neighborhood development adjacent the southern portion of the site has an outfall that routes three
 storm drains into the ravine to the east of the campus.   These drains capture run-off from Skyline
 Boulevard and upper Rowan Tree Lane.  

 Proposed Improvements

 Site improvements will include the construction of 0.93 acres (40,500 sq.ft.) of new building footprint. As
 a result, the net increase in impervious surfaces is only 24,816 sq.ft. The new ratio will be 82% pervious
 and 18% impervious.

 The site redevelopment will increase runoff. For a rain event of 0.2 in/hr intensity, the runoff will increase
 from 1.5 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 1.7 cfs, an increase of approximately 9%. Multiple strategies can
 be employed to offset this increase in direct runoff from the impervious surface so that the actual
 stormwater discharge from the site will not increase. Strategies to capture runoff, slow the runoff, and
 infiltrate the runoff can be utilized.

Regarding:    Events at The Nueva School 
 
Dear Nueva Neighbors: 
 
On Sunday, March 14, from 12:00 ­ 4:00pm, Nueva will be hosting our Math, Science &
Tech Fair. Nueva will be transformed into a practical exploratorium of interactive
exhibits, inventions, experiments, and pavilions. Gravity will be manipulated, speakers
will captivate, and complicated machines will perform not-so-complicated tasks.

On Tuesday, March 16, from 7:00pm ­ 9:00pm, Nueva will also be hosting Common
Ground speaker Nancy Samalin M.S. Nancy Samalin is one of America's most
influential parent educators and the author of four highly acclaimed books, including
Loving Without Spoiling, Loving Each One Best and Love & Anger. She is a funny,
straight-talking speaker who has engaged audiences on Good Morning America, The
Today Show and National Public Radio.

We are anticipating 400 to 500 guests for both of these events and expecting heavier
traffic than normal on Skyline Boulevard. The Hillsborough police have been notified
and will provide officers to assist with traffic congestion. We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.

I would like to extend a personal invitation to our Nueva neighbors to join us in the
Gymnasium Community Center on the Nueva campus for both of our upcoming events.

We appreciate your support.

Sincerely,


Diane Rosenberg
