BACKGROUND:

Request

An application and plans for a Conditional Use Permit Modification (CUP
Mod) for the Wildwood School, located at 12201 Washington Place, were
submitted on December 5, 2012 by the Wildwood School (the "Applicant").
The Applicant is requesting approval to allow an increase in enrollment from
300 students to a maximum of 400 students. The Applicant is also requesting
that the CUP be extended for a period of 35 years to December 31, 2046,
commensurate with the Applicant's new lease agreement for the site with the
Culver City Unified School District.

Existing Conditions

The project site is the former Betsy Ross Elementary School which was declared
surplus property by the Culver City Unified School District (CCUSD) in 1983. It is
presently under a long term lease and occupied by the Wildwood School, a
private educational facility serving grades K-5. The Applicant's current lease
extends for 24 years, beginning in 1991 and running through December 31,
2015. The new lease signed by the Applicant with CCUSD extended the term of
the lease an additional 35 years to December 31, 2046.

The project site is located on the north side of Washington Place, between Grand
View Boulevard and Centinela Avenue. To the north of the project site is Los
Angeles Unified School District's Grand View Elementary School. To the west, in
the City of Culver City, are several multi-family residential dwellings. South of the
subject site, across Washington Place are multi-family residential dwellings, and
east, across Grand View Boulevard, are single-story commercial uses and multi-
family residential dwellings located in the City of Los Angeles.

After being declared surplus property by CCUSD, the school was first occupied
by the University of West Los Angeles, a private adult educational facility for law
and paralegal services. The school was established by Planning Commission
actions included Zone Change, PL-1394 (from R-1 to R-4), and Conditional Use
Permit, PL-1393, for conversion of the surplus school site into a private adult
educational facility.

In May 1992, the Planning Commission approved applications filed by the
Wildwood School to change the use of the site to a private elementary
educational facility (Modification No. 1 to Conditional Use Permit, PL-1393), and
to use three temporary classroom modular structures (Special Permit, SP No.
92-02). The CUP was approved for a 24 year period (to December 31, 2015)


                                  Page 2 of 7
                             City of Culver City, California
                 Planning Commission Agenda Item Report




commensurate with the schools lease with CCUSD In September 1992, the
Planning Commission approved the architectural plans to construct a new two-
story, 7,870 square foot classroom structure through Modification No. 2 to
Conditional Use Permit, PL-1393.

In May 1998, the Planning Commission approved an application for Modification
No. 3 filed by the Applicant to allow a 4,700 square foot addition of classroom
and storage space, to permit the raising of the roof of the auditorium by four feet
and to retain the existing maximum number of teachers and employees at
Wildwood School. The number of students enrolled was also increased from 280
to 300.

The Wildwood School campus is presently comprised of 16 regular classrooms
and four specialist classrooms. On-site facilities also include a track and field,
playground areas, a library, an auditorium, and administrative offices. The school
also provides an on-site parking lot along the west side of the campus which
provides parking for staff and visitors, as well as queuing area for parents during
drop-off and pick-up activities. See attached site plan (Attachment No. 3)

Classes begin at 8:45 AM for all grades each weekday, with dismissal staggered
between 3:00 PM and 3:15 PM, Monday thru Thursday, and 1:45 and 2:00 PM
on Friday.


Project Description

The project involves the addition of 100 students to the Wildwood School,
increasing the student population from 300 students to a maximum of 400
students. The applicant anticipates increasing the student enrollment by up to 24
students for the 2013-2014 school year, with the proposed addition of 12
kindergarten and 12 first-grade students and reach the full 400 student
enrollment by the 2020 school year. The project will not result in the addition of
any new floor area, however a school administrative office will be converted to a
classroom, and four full-time administrative employees will be relocated to the
school's other campus as part of the school's immediate addition of 24 new
students. The increase in total enrollment to 400 students by 2020 will be
accommodated in the school's existing buildings and will not require the addition
of new building area.

                  Planning Commission Agenda Item Report




Entitlement Request and Applicable Zoning Code Sections

The proposed entitlement request is a Modification to an existing Conditional Use
Permit (Modification No. 4) to permit the addition of 100 students to the Wildwood
School, increasing the student enrollment from 300 students to 400 students.
The school is not requesting an addition of floor area or a change to the project
site layout.

Zoning Code Section 17.595.035 requires that a major change to an approved
project, shall be approved, modified or denied by the original review authority.
The addition of 100 students to the Wildwood School will result in a major change
to the approved Conditional Use Permit request, Conditional Use Permit PL-
1393, and therefore a modification to the CUP must be approved by the Planning
Commission.

On Tuesday, December 4, 2012 at 7:00 PM, the Applicant held a community
meeting to discuss the project with neighbors. A notice was sent to owners and
occupants within 500 feet of the project site, however there were no attendees.


ANALYSIS:

Parking

A total of 56 parking spaces are provided on-site to serve the school staff, faculty
and visitors, in excess of the 44 parking spaces required by the zoning code. The
zoning code requires 1.5 spaces per classroom and 1 space per 200 square feet
of assembly area. The school has 21 classrooms resulting in the need for 32
parking spaces. The school has a 2,488 square auditorium which requires 12
parking spaces for a total onsite parking requirement of 44 spaces.

The Applicant also has an agreement with the Culver City Church of God,
located at 3998 Centinela Avenue (at the northeast corner of Washington Place
and Centinela Avenue) to allow up to 28 cars to park on the site during school
days. The Church lot provides parking for parents during drop-off and pick-up
times, and on-campus activities.

Traffic and Circulation

Access to the parking lot is provided through two primary driveways, both off of
Mitchell Avenue. An egress only driveway is provided off of Washington Place.
The present on-site circulation allows for on-site queuing of vehicles during drop-
off and pick-up periods in the morning and afternoon, respectively. Vehicles enter


                                  Page 4 of 7
                             City of Culver City, California
                 Planning Commission Agenda Item Report




off of Mitchell Avenue and pull forward to the active loading spaces in the drive
aisle. Vehicles are queued in two side-by-side lines. The drop-off and pick-up
area allows for queuing of up to 20 vehicles on-site (with four active loading
spaces and 16 queuing area spaces). During a site visit in October 2012, staff
observed the queuing process during a typical afternoon pick-up period. Traffic
moved efficiently around the surrounding streets with school staff both on- and
off-site directing parent vehicles where to queue, and assisting pedestrians to
move safely around the active driveways. It was also observed that a number of
parents walked on to the campus to pick-up their children. The Applicant has
coordinated drop-off and pick-up times with the Grand View Elementary School,
located to the north of the project site, in order to reduce traffic and parking
impacts on adjacent streets. The north side of Mitchell Avenue, in the City of Los
Angeles, also has restricted parking limited to 15 minutes on school days which
accommodates on street parking for drop off and pick up at both schools. The
Applicant is not proposing to change the parking lot configuration or on-site
circulation.

As part of the Traffic Study prepared for the project, dated November 2012, by
Gibson Transportation Consulting, Inc. (Attachment No. 4), an analysis of the
queuing was prepared to determine if the current queuing measures were
adequate to handle future operations with 400 students. Based on the analysis in
the Traffic Study, the four active loading spaces and 16 queuing area spaces on
the site are anticipated to adequately accommodate the queue length during the
morning peak drop-off period and each afternoon peak pick-up period for the 400
students without any overflow queuing on Mitchell Avenue or any other adjacent
streets.

The Traffic Study also evaluated the forecasted completion date of the project
(year 2020) conditions at seven intersections in the immediate vicinity during
both the AM and PM peak hours:

   1. Centinela Avenue and Mitchell Avenue
   2. Grand View Boulevard and Mitchell Avenue
   3. Centinela Avenue and Washington Place
   4. Grand View Boulevard and Washington Place
   5. Inglewood Boulevard and Washington Place
   6. Centinela Avenue and Washington Boulevard
   7. Centinela Avenue and Venice Boulevard

The traffic analysis estimated that the project, an increase of 100 students to
create a 400 student private elementary school, would generate 90 net new daily
trips (50 inbound, 40 outbound), during the AM peak hour, and 60 net new daily
trips (28 inbound, 32 outbound) per hour during the PM peak hour. These net


                                 Page 5 of 7
                              City of Culver City, California
                  Planning Commission Agenda Item Report




new daily trips would be in addition to the existing (2012) and future (2020) traffic
volumes at these intersections. The Traffic Study found that at the seven studied
intersections incremental increases in V/C, which do not rise to the level of
significance, occur during the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours.
Therefore, the study determined that project would not result in any traffic
impacts.

Offsite/Streetscape Improvements

The Public Works Department has proposed several off-site and on-site
improvements related to the project. First, in conformance with the City's Bicycle
Master Plan, secure short-term bicycle parking shall be provided by the school in
order to provide one (1) space for each ten (10) employees and one (1) space for
each twenty (20) students.

Public Works will also require improvements to be made to abutting sidewalks to
fix uneven sidewalks and improve ADA accessibility at the curb ramp at the
corner of Washington Place and Grand View Boulevard.


CONCLUSION:

The Wildwood School has been operating at the subject location for over 20
years. The school is located on a former CCUSD elementary school site that the
CCUSD has leased to the Wildwood School since 1992. The lease was recently
extended to the year 2046. There are no impacts to the City's commercial land
uses as the property has always been used for a school and the current school
campus can accommodate the proposed increase in student enrollment to a
maximum of 400 students without creating any significant impacts. For
comparison purposes it is noted that CCUSD's 5 elementary schools (K-5) have
student enrollment ranging from 500 to 750 students.

The increase in enrollment will not create any significant parking, circulation or
traffic impacts The project is a conditionally permitted use in the zone and
consistent with the General Plan. Therefore, based on the analysis contained
herein staff believes the findings for a Conditional Use Permit Modification can
be made as outlined in proposed Resolution No. 2013-P004 (Attachment No. 1)
and recommends project approval.

13          CCMC Section 17.210.015, Table 2-2 "Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements for
            Residential Zoning Districts." The private school use on the project site was originally
14
            permitted under Conditional Use Permit, CUP PL-1393, adopted on March 14, 1984.
15          The request to increase student enrollment from 300 to 400 students at the private
            school use complies with all applicable provisions of this Title and the CCMC.
16
     B.     The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable
17
            Specific Plan.
18
            The use of the project site for a 400 student private elementary school use is
19          consistent with the General Plan Land Use Designation of Medium Density Multiple
20
            Family Residential/School. The Medium Density Multiple Family Residential land use
            designation corresponds to the RMD Zone, which permits private school uses subject
21          to a Conditional Use Permit. The project site is not subject to any specific plan.
22
     C.     The design, location, size and operating characteristics of the proposed use are
23          compatible with the existing and future land use in the vicinity of the subject
            site.
24
            The design, location, size and operating characteristics of the 400 student private
25
            school use will not have an impact on adjacent uses and is therefore found to be
26          compatible with the existing and future educational, residential and commercial land
            uses in the vicinity of the subject site. The school use will not adversely affect nearby
27          properties because all school activities will be located within the approved project
28          campus area. In addition, the project will be subject to conditions of approval in order
            to enforce compatibility with adjacent uses.

     D.     The subject site is physically suitable for the type and intensity of use being
2           proposed, including access, compatibility with adjoining land uses, shape, size,
            provision of utilities and the absence of physical constraints.

            The project site has been used as a school for many years, first as Culver City Unified
            School District's (CCUSD) Betsy Ross Elementary School, then as a private adult
5           education law school, and now as a private elementary school. The project site is
            owned by CCUSD and leased to the Wildwood School for a period extending through
6
            the year 2046. The 400 student school will be accommodated in existing buildings on
7           the existing school campus. The City's Traffic Engineer has reviewed the proposed
            project and based on the transportation study, the project will result in less than
8           significant impacts on surrounding streets. In addition, on-site circulation will be able to
            accommodate the drop-off and pick-up activities for the 400 student school.
9

10   E.     The establishment, maintenance or operation of the proposed use will not be
            detrimental to the public interest, health, safety or general welfare or injurious to
11          persons, property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which
12
            the property is located.

13          The establishment of a 400 student private elementary school through this approval,
            subject to the conditions of approval, will not be detrimental to the public interest,
14
            health, safety or general welfare or injurious to persons, property or improvements in
15          the surrounding zoning districts or vicinity.

16
            SECTION 2.       Pursuant to the foregoing recitations and findings, the Planning
17

18   Commission of the City of Culver City, California, hereby approves Conditional Use Permit
19   Modification, CUP/M P-2012171, subject to the conditions of approval set forth in Exhibit A
20
     attached hereto and incorporated in herein by this reference.

This traffic study presents the traffic impact analysis for the proposed expansion of the
Wildwood Lower School student enrollment (the "Project"). The methodology and base
assumptions used in the analysis were established in conjunction with the City of Culver City
and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT).




PROJECT LOCATION


The Project site (the "Site") is bound by Mitchell Avenue to the north, Grand View Boulevard to
the east, Washington Place to the south, and adjacent properties to the east in the City of
Culver City.   The Site lies within an urbanized area consisting of commercial, office and
residential uses. Surrounding uses include a public elementary school, various retail centers,
and multi-family residential complexes.




EXISTING SITE CONDITIONS


The student enrollment at the Wildwood School currently stands at 300 students. The Wildwood
School schedule consists of an 8:45 A.M. start time on Monday through Friday and a staggered
dismissal at 3:00 P.M. and 3:15 P.M. on Monday through Thursday and 1:45 P.M. and 2:00
P.M. on Friday. It should be noted that the start and dismissal times do not coincide with the
start and dismissal times at the adjacent public schools. The peak student drop-off hour (8:15
A.M. to 9:15 A.M.) in the morning and the peak student pick-up hour (3:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M.) in
the afternoon occur during the commuter peak morning and afternoon periods (7:00 to 10:00
A.M. and 3:00 to 6:00 P.M.). Currently, vehicles enter the pick-up/drop-off area via the Mitchell
Avenue driveway and exit via the Washington Place driveway.




                                                                                                1
PROJECT DESCRIPTION


Wildwood School proposes to increase its current student enrollment by 100 students from 300
to a maximum of 400 students. The initial increase in enrollment of 25 students would occur
during the 2013-2014 school year. Additional students, up to a maximum permitted enrollment
of 400 students, would be added between the 2014 and 2020 school year. The Project is
anticipated to be complete by 2020.

                                          Traffic Impact Analysis Methodology


This chapter describes the various traffic scenarios analyzed, the methodologies used for
assessing intersection and street segment operating conditions, and significant traffic impact
criteria for the jurisdictions overseeing the analysis.




STUDY SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY


This traffic study follows the City of Culver City's Traffic Study Criteria for the Review of Proposed
Development Projects within the City of Culver City (2012) and LADOT's Traffic Study Policies
and Procedures (May 2012), which establish the guidelines for determining the appropriate
analysis methodologies and significance thresholds for the Project. The scope of analysis for this
study was developed in consultation with the City of Culver City and LADOT staff. The analysis
was conducted using the morning and afternoon peak hours of the school, both of which occur
during the commuter morning (7:00 to 10:00 A.M.) and afternoon (3:00 to 6:00 P.M.) peak
periods, respectively. The base assumptions and technical methodologies (i.e., trip generation,
study locations, analysis methodology, etc.) were identified as part of the study approach and
were outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which was reviewed and approved by
the City of Culver City. A copy of the MOU is provided in Appendix A.


The traffic impact study evaluates the potential for impacts caused by the Project on the street
system surrounding the Project site. Consistent with Traffic Study Criteria and Traffic Study
Policies and Procedures, the following analysis conditions are analyzed for the Project:


       Existing Conditions (2012) ­ The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a basis
       for the assessment of existing plus project and future traffic conditions. The Existing
       Conditions analysis includes a description of key area streets and highways, traffic
       volumes, and current operating conditions.
       Intersection turning movement counts for typical weekday morning (7:00 a.m. to 10:00
       a.m.) and afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods were collected in January and
       June 2012 while local schools were in session. Fieldwork (lane configurations, signal

       phasing, parking restrictions, etc.) for the analyzed intersections was collected in
       February and June 2012.
       Existing Plus Project Conditions (2012) ­ The California Environmental Quality Act
       (CEQA), the City of Culver City, and LADOT require an evaluation of project traffic
       impacts on the existing environment as part of traffic impact analyses. This analysis
       evaluates the potential Project-related traffic impacts as compared to existing conditions.
       Future without Project Conditions (2020) ­ This analysis projects the future traffic growth
       and intersection operating conditions that could be expected as a result of regional
       growth and related projects in the vicinity of the Project Site by year 2020. The Future
       without Project traffic conditions are projected by adding ambient traffic growth and
       traffic from related projects to existing conditions. This analysis provides the baseline
       conditions by which Project impacts are evaluated at full buildout.
       Future Plus Project Conditions (2020) ­ This analysis identifies the potential incremental
       impacts of the Project at full buildout, prior to mitigation, on projected future traffic
       operating conditions by adding the net Project-generated traffic to the Future without
       Project traffic forecasts (year 2020).




IMPACT CRITERIA AND SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS


The significance of the potential impacts of Project generated traffic at each study intersection
was identified using criteria identified in Traffic Study Criteria and Traffic Study Policies and
Procedures. According to the Culver City and LADOT sliding scale method for calculating the
level of impact due to traffic generated by a proposed project, a significant transportation impact
is determined based on the criteria presented below:

The relative impact of the added traffic volumes to be generated by the Project was evaluated
based on analysis of operating conditions at the study intersections, with and without the
Project.

As required by Traffic Study Criteria and Traffic Study Policies and Procedures, the Project's
impacts were evaluated against the Existing (2012) and Future (2020) traffic conditions. The
following discussion details the capacity analysis procedures utilized to evaluate the volume-to-
capacity (V/C) relationships and level of service (LOS) characteristics at each study intersection.




Congestion Management Program Analysis


The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a state-mandated program that serves as the
monitoring and analytical basis for transportation funding decisions in the county made through
the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) and State Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP) processes. The CMP requires that a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) be performed
for all CMP arterial monitoring intersections where a project would add 50 or more trips during
either the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours and all mainline freeway monitoring locations
where a project would add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during the morning or afternoon
weekday peak hours.


The CMP required for the Project has been performed, in Chapter 9, in accordance with the TIA
guidelines referenced in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County
(Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority [Metro], 2010).

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of
existing conditions in the Project Study Area. The existing conditions analysis relevant to this
study includes an assessment of the existing street system, an analysis of traffic volumes and
current operating conditions, and an analysis of the existing public transit service.




STUDY AREA


The Study Area includes a geographic area approximately 0.25 miles (north-south) by
approximately one mile (east-west). This Study Area was established in consultation with the City
of Culver City and LADOT and by reviewing the existing intersection/corridor operations, Project
peak hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of Project vehicular trips, and the
potential impacts of Project traffic.


A traffic analysis study area generally comprises those locations with the greatest potential to
experience significant traffic impacts due to the Project as defined by the lead agency. In the
traffic engineering practice, a study area generally includes those intersections that are:


    1. Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site
    2. In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected future
       adverse operational issues
    3. In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
       percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
       intersections)

The Project Study Area was designed to ensure that all potentially significantly impacted
intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed, and the boundary of the Study Area was
extended, as necessary, to confirm that there were no significant impacts at or outside the
boundary of the Study Area by reviewing the Project traffic's travel patterns.




                                                                                                  6
A total of five signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersections in the Study Area were
identified during the MOU process for detailed analysis of the above conditions:


       1.      Centinela Avenue & Mitchell Avenue (Culver City / Los Angeles)
       2.      Grand View Boulevard & Mitchell Avenue (Culver City / Los Angeles)
       3.      Centinela Avenue & Washington Place (Culver City)
       4.      Grand View Boulevard & Washington Place (Culver City)
       5.      Inglewood Boulevard & Washington Place (Los Angeles)
       6.      Centinela Avenue & Washington Boulevard (Culver City)
       7.      Centinela Avenue & Venice Boulevard (Los Angeles)


Figure 1 illustrates the location of the Site in relation to the surrounding street system and the
seven analyzed intersections.




EXISTING STREET SYSTEM


The existing street system in the Study Area consists of a regional roadway system including
principal and secondary arterials and collector and local streets.       The secondary arterials,
collectors, and selected local streets in the Study Area offer sub-regional and local access and
circulation opportunities. These transportation facilities generally provide two to six travel lanes
and usually allow parking on either side of the street. Typically, the speed limits range between
25 and 40 miles per hour (mph) on the principal and secondary arterials, collector, and local
streets.




Roadway Descriptions


Primary regional access to the Project site is provided by Interstate 405 (I-405) (the San Diego
Freeway), which generally runs north-south in the Study Area. I-405 is located approximately one
quarter-mile to the east of the Site. Access to and from I-405 is available via interchanges at
Sawtelle Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard between Venice Boulevard and Washington
Boulevard.

INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODOLOGY


As required by the City of Culver City, the signalized study intersections under Culver City
jurisdiction were evaluated using the Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) methodology, which
determines V/C ratios on a critical movement basis. As required by LADOT, the signalized study
intersections under the City of Los Angeles jurisdiction were evaluated using the Critical
Movement Analysis (CMA) methodology. The overall intersection V/C ratio is subsequently
assigned an LOS value to describe intersection operations. LOS is a qualitative measure used
to describe the traffic flow conditions. Table 2 presents a description of the LOS categories,
which range from excellent, nearly free-flow traffic at LOS A to stop-and-go conditions at LOS F.


The unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
(Transportation Research Board, 2000) methodology, which determines the average total
control delay (seconds/vehicle). The overall intersection average delay is subsequently
assigned an LOS value to describe intersection operations. Table 3 presents a description of
the LOS categories.




Computer Traffic Signal Control


The Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) system represents an advanced
system in computer control of traffic signals. It was first put into operation in June 1984 in the
Coliseum area of the City of Los Angeles to anticipate the expected increase in traffic due to the
Summer Olympic Games, and has since been expanded to other parts of the City.                 The
advantages of ATSAC-controlled traffic signals are substantial, including real-time adjustment of
signal timing plans to reflect changing traffic conditions, identification of unusual traffic
conditions caused by incidents, the ability to implement special purpose short-term signal timing
changes in response to incidents, and the ability to identify signal equipment malfunctions
quickly. LADOT estimates that implementation of this system improves intersection capacity by
an average of 7%.


In addition to ATSAC, the Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS) has been tested and
implemented along major travel corridors in the City of Los Angeles. ATCS is a computer-
based traffic signal control program that provides fully responsive traffic signal control based on



                                                                                                 10
real-time traffic conditions.   It automatically adjusts and optimizes traffic signal timing in
response to current traffic demands on the entire signal network such that the number of stops
and the amount of delay is minimized along with improved traffic signal coordination throughout
the network.     LADOT estimates that implementation of this system improves intersection
capacity by an additional 3% over those operating under the ATSAC system alone.


ATCS and ATSAC are in place at the intersections of Inglewood Boulevard & Washington Place
and Centinela Avenue & Venice Avenue. In accordance with standard LADOT procedures, a
capacity increase of 10% (0.10 V/C adjustment) was applied to reflect the benefits of ATCS and
ATSAC control at this intersection.


The City of Culver City has adopted a signal synchronization system equivalent to LADOT's
ATSAC. The signal synchronization system allows for a 7% capacity increase (0.70 V/C
adjustment).


This synchronization system is in place at Centinela Avenue & Washington Place and Grand
View Avenue & Washington Place. While the Cities of Culver City and Los Angeles hold joint
jurisdiction of the intersections, the City of Culver City controls these intersections. Therefore, to
provide a conservative analysis, a capacity increase of 7% (0.07 V/C adjustment) was applied to
reflect the benefits.




EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE


This section presents the existing peak hour turning movement traffic volumes for the
intersections analyzed in the study, describes the methodology used to assess the traffic
conditions at each intersection, and analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each
intersection indicating V/C ratios and LOS.




                                                                                                    11
Existing Traffic Volumes


Intersection turning movement counts during the typical weekday morning (7:00 a.m. to 10:00
p.m.) and afternoon (3:00 PM to 6:00 PM) commuter peak periods were conducted at the seven
study intersections in January and June, 2012. The existing intersection traffic volumes can be
found in Figure 3. The summary data worksheets of turning movement counts at the study
intersections are available in Appendix C.


The traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 3 were analyzed to determine the existing operating
conditions at the analyzed intersections.




Existing Intersection Levels of Service


Table 4 summarizes the existing weekday afternoon peak hour V/C ratio or average delay and
the corresponding LOS for each of the analyzed intersections. As summarized in Table 4, the
seven study intersections analyzed operate at LOS D or better during both the morning and
afternoon peak hours under Existing conditions. The LOS calculation worksheets are provided
in Appendix D.

                                  Future without Project Traffic Conditions


Estimates of future traffic conditions both with and without the Project were developed to evaluate
the potential impacts of the Project on the local street system.      This discussion details the
assumptions used to develop the Future (Year 2020) without Project conditions.


In order to develop the Future without Project traffic conditions, the existing traffic volumes were
factored upward by a 1% annual ambient growth rate to approximate regional growth and
development. In addition to this ambient growth, related projects traffic must also be added to
estimate the Future without Project (Year 2020) traffic conditions.




CEQA GUIDELINES REGARDING FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS


The forecast of Future without Project conditions was prepared in accordance with procedures
outlined in Section 15130 of Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality
Act, Chapter 3, Title 14, California Code of Regulations (California Natural Resources Agency,
amended July 27, 2007). Specifically, Guidelines provides two options for developing the
cumulative traffic volume forecast:


       "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
       cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
       the [lead] agency, or

       (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted general plan or related
       planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted
       or certified, which described or evaluated regional or area wide conditions
       contributing to the cumulative impact. Any such planning document shall be
       referenced and made available to the public at a location specified by the lead
       agency."




                                                                                                  20
Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of Future without Project
traffic volumes as it incorporates both the "A" and "B" options outlined in Guidelines for purposes
of developing the forecast.




FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The existing plus ambient growth traffic volumes were combined with the related project
volumes to form the Future without Project conditions. This scenario forms the basis of the
evaluation of Project impacts in the Future plus Project (Year 2020) conditions.




Ambient Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase as a result of regional growth and development. Culver
City guidelines require the use of a 1% per year ambient growth rate. The total adjustment
applied over the eight-year period was therefore 8%.




Related Projects


In accordance with the CEQA requirements in Guidelines, this study considers the effects of the
Project in relation to other developments either proposed, approved, or under construction in the
Study Area.     These development proposals (called related projects) are expected to be
implemented in the vicinity of the Site prior to the buildout date of the Project.         With this
information, the potential impact of the proposed Project can be evaluated within the context of
the cumulative impact of all ongoing development.


The list of related projects is based on information provided by the City of Culver City Planning
Department and LADOT. The related projects located within a 1.5 mile radius of the Project Site
are detailed in Table 5. The locations of these related projects are shown in Figure 4, while
Figure 5 depicts the traffic volumes associated with these projects at the study intersections.




                                                                                                  21
The development of estimated traffic volumes added to the Study Area as a result of related
projects involves the use of a three-step process: trip generation, trip distribution, and traffic
assignment.


Trip generation estimates for the related projects were provided by LADOT or were calculated
using a combination of previous study findings and the trip generation rates contained in Trip
Generation, 8th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2008). As shown in Table 5, the
related projects are expected to generate approximately 6,295 daily trips on a typical weekday,
including 817 morning peak hour trips and 949 afternoon peak hour trips. These projections are
conservative in that they do not in every case account for either the existing uses to be removed
or the likely use of other travel modes (transit, walk, etc.)


The geographic distribution of the traffic generated by the related projects is dependent on several
factors. These factors include the type and density of the proposed land uses, the geographic
distribution of the population from which the employees/residents and potential patrons of the
proposed developments are drawn, and the location of these projects in relation to the
surrounding street system. These factors are considered along with logical travel routes through
the street system to develop a reasonable pattern of trip distribution.


The trip generation estimates for the related projects were assigned to the local street system
using the trip distribution pattern described immediately above. These volumes were then added
to the existing traffic volumes after adjustment for ambient growth through the projected buildout
year of 2020. These volumes represent the Future without Project conditions (i.e., cumulative
traffic volumes, ambient traffic growth, and related project traffic growth).


The resulting Future without Project peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 6.



Future Roadway Improvements


Based on discussions with the City of Culver City and LADOT traffic engineers, there are no future
roadway improvements (either programmed improvements or other mitigation for other recently
approved developments) in the Study Area that are anticipated to be fully funded and constructed




                                                                                                  22
prior to the buildout of the Project (i.e., 2020). Thus, no future roadway improvements were
included as part of the future conditions analyses.




INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Future without Project Intersection Levels of Service


Table 6 summarizes the analysis of the Future without Project traffic conditions. Of the seven
analyzed intersections, five are projected to operate at LOS D or better during the morning and
afternoon peak hours under Future without Project conditions. The intersection of Centinela
Avenue & Washington Boulevard is projected to operate at LOS E during the morning peak hour
and LOS D during the afternoon peak hour under Future without Project conditions. The
intersection of Centinela Avenue & Venice Boulevard is projected to operate at LOS E during
both the morning and afternoon peak hours under Future without conditions.

A trip generation estimate, trip distribution pattern and trip assignment were prepared for the
Project. These components form the basis of the Project's traffic impact analysis.




PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The first step of the forecasting process is trip generation, which estimates the total arriving and
departing trips generated by the Project on a peak hour and daily basis by applying the
appropriate vehicle trip generation equations, or rates, to the size of Project development.


The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound Project trips. These origins and destinations are typically
based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the Study Area. Localized
routes of travel through the Study Area are developed based on existing traffic patterns and
relative travel times on various corridors.


The third step of the forecasting process is traffic assignment. This involves applying the traffic
generated by the Project (the trip generation) to the intersections and street segments in the
Study Area according to the projected trip distribution patterns. These traffic volumes can then be
added to existing or future background conditions to represent traffic volumes once the Project is
complete.


With the forecasting process complete and Project traffic assignments developed, the impact of
the proposed Project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., LOS) conditions at the study
intersections using expected future traffic volumes without and with forecast Project traffic. The
need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic improvements can then be evaluated and
the significance of the Project's impacts identified.




                                                                                                  29
Project Trip Generation


The most recent trip generation rate from Trip Generation, 8th Edition for Land Use Code 534
(Private School) was used to develop the Project trip generation estimates.


As described, the Project would increase student enrollment from 300 to 400 students. Thus,
the trip generation forecast shown in Table 7 accounts for the increased student enrollment and
reflects the net new trips associated with the Project.


As shown in Table 7, the Project is anticipated to generate 90 net new trips (50 inbound, 40
outbound) during the morning peak hour and 60 net new trips (28 inbound, 32 outbound) in the
afternoon peak hour.




Project Trip Distribution


Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the Project Site have been distributed and
assigned to the local street system based on student zip code data provided by Wildwood
Schools. The general distribution pattern was reviewed and approved by the City of Culver City
and LADOT.




Project Trip Assignment


Project traffic was assigned to the surrounding street system based the following distribution
pattern: approximately 37% of the traffic was assigned to/from the north, 9% was assigned
to/from the east, 3% was assigned to/from the south, and 51% was assigned to/from the west.
The detailed distribution of Project traffic through the study intersections is illustrated in Figure
7. The trip distribution pattern was applied to the trip generation to develop the Project-only
traffic assignments.

This Chapter describes the evaluation of Project traffic on the existing environment.




TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Existing (Year 2012) Plus Project Traffic Volumes


The Project-only traffic volumes described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 8 were added to
the Existing traffic volumes shown in Figure 3. The resulting Existing Plus Project peak hour
traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 9. These volumes are the sum of the existing traffic
volumes and Project-only traffic. They represent Existing Plus Project conditions, i.e., existing
conditions after the development of the Project in the Year 2012.

Table 8 shows the results of the Existing plus Project analysis at the study intersections. Similar
to Existing conditions, all seven study intersections operate at LOS D or better with the addition
of Project related traffic.

                                                   Future with Project Conditions


This Chapter describes the evaluation of the Project traffic on future background traffic. The
horizon year (year 2020) corresponds with the anticipated buildout year of the Project, and all
future background traffic growth (i.e., ambient and related project traffic growth) is assumed in this
analysis.




TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Future Plus Project Traffic Volumes


The Project-only traffic volumes described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 8 were added to
the Future without Project traffic volumes shown in Figure 6. The resulting Future with Project
peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 10. These volumes are the sum of the existing
traffic volumes, ambient growth, related project traffic, and Project-only traffic. They represent
Future with Project conditions, i.e., future conditions after the development of the Project in the
year 2020.



INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Future Plus Project (Year 2020) Intersection LOS


Table 9 shows the results of the Future plus Project analysis at the study intersections. Five of
the seven study intersections operate at LOS D or better during both the morning and afternoon
peak hours under Future Plus Project conditions. The intersection of Centinela Avenue &
Washington Boulevard is projected to operate at LOS E during the morning peak hour and LOS

Notes:
 [a] Intersection is unsignalized. LOS is based on average control delay as caluculated using the HCM methodology. A v/c ratio is also provided to
     project related impacts per Culver City and Los Angeles criteria
 [b] Culver City intersections operate under signal synchronization equivalent to LADOT's ATCS. A credit of 0.07 in V/C ratio was included in the analysis.
 [c] All Los Angeles intersections operate under the LADOT Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS). A credit of 0.10 in V/C ratio was included in the analysis.

The relative impact of the added Project traffic volumes during the peak hours was evaluated
based on analysis of both existing and future operating conditions at the study intersections
without and with the Project. The previously discussed significance criteria and thresholds
outlined in Chapter 2 were used to determine the significance of a traffic impact caused by the
Project on the study intersections.




EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS


As shown in Table 10, application of the City of Culver City and LADOT significant impact
criteria to the Existing plus Project scenario indicates that the Project is not anticipated to result
in significant impacts at the study intersections during the weekday peak hours. Incremental
increases in V/C, which do not rise to the level of significance as defined in Chapter 2, are noted
at the seven intersections under the Existing plus Project conditions during the weekday
morning and afternoon peak hours.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS


As shown in Table 11, application of the City of Culver City and LADOT significant impact
criteria to the Future with Project scenario indicates that the Project is not anticipated to result in
any significant impacts at the study intersections during the weekday peak hours. Incremental
increases in V/C or delay, which do not rise to the level of significance as defined in Chapter 2,
are noted at the seven study intersections under the Future with Project conditions during the
weekday morning and afternoon peak hours.




                                                                                                     40
MITIGATION MEASURES


The Project is not anticipated to result in significant traffic impacts at any of the analyzed study
intersections and, therefore, no traffic mitigation measures are required to reduce Project impacts
to less than significant levels.

                              Congestion Management Program Analysis


CMP ANALYSIS


The CMP requires that, when a TIA is prepared for a project, traffic and transit impact analyses
be conducted for select regional facilities based on the amount of project traffic expected to use
these facilities.




CMP SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACT CRITERIA


The CMP guidelines state that a CMP freeway analysis must be conducted if 150 or more trips
attributable to the proposed development are added to a mainline freeway monitoring location in
either direction during the morning or afternoon weekday peak hours. Similarly, a CMP arterial
monitoring station analysis must be conducted if 50 or more peak hour project trips are added to
a CMP arterial monitoring station during the morning or afternoon weekday commuter peak
hours.


A significant project-related CMP impact would be identified if the CMP facility is projected to
operate at LOS F (V/C > 1.00) and if the project traffic causes an incremental change in the V/C
ratio of 0.02 or greater. The proposed development would not be considered to have a
regionally significant impact, regardless of the increase in V/C ratio, if the analyzed facility is
projected to operate at LOS E or better after the addition of the project traffic.




CMP FREEWAY ANALYSIS


Based on the Project trip generation estimates shown in Table 6, the Project is expected to
generate approximately 90 net new trips in the morning peak hour and 60 net new trips in the
afternoon peak hour. According to the Project trip distribution illustrated in Figure 8, there would




                                                                                                  44
be fewer than 150 PM peak hour trips distributed to the freeways in the Study Area; therefore,
the Project's CMP freeway impacts are considered to be less than significant and no further
analysis is required.




CMP ARTERIAL MONITORING STATION ANALYSIS


The CMP arterial monitoring station closest to the Project site is the intersection of:


       Centinela Avenue & Venice Boulevard, approximately one quarter-mile northwest of the
       Project site.


According to the Project trip distribution illustrated in Figure 10, there would be 28 morning peak
hour and 20 afternoon peak hour trips traveling past the monitoring station at Centinela Avenue
and Venice Boulevard. This is fewer than the 50 peak trips that would trigger further analysis;
therefore, the Project's CMP arterial impacts are considered to be less than significant, and no
further analysis is required.




REGIONAL TRANSIT IMPACT ANALYSIS


Section B.8.4 of the CMP provides a methodology for estimating the number of transit trips
expected to result from a proposed project based on the number of vehicle trips.              This
methodology assumes average vehicle occupancy (AVO) factor of 1.4 in order to estimate the
number of person trips to and from the project. The CMP guidelines estimate that approximately
3.5% of total project person trips may use public transit to travel to and from the site.


As shown in Table 6, the Project is expected to generate approximately 60 afternoon peak hour
trips. Assuming an AVO of 1.4, the Project's vehicle trips result in an estimated increase of 84
person trips during the afternoon peak hour. Using the 3.5% mode split suggested in the CMP,
the Project would generate approximately three net new transit trips in the weekday afternoon
peak hour.     The Project location is well served by numerous established transit routes.




                                                                                                 45
It is anticipated that the existing transit service in the Project vicinity will adequately
accommodate the Project-generated transit trips.


Thus, based on the calculated number of generated transit trips, impacts on existing or future
transit services in the Project vicinity are not expected to be significant.




                                                                                            46

                                         Site Access and Internal Circulation


PROJECT SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION


Three driveways, two located on Mitchell Avenue and one on Washington Place, serve the
Project Site. The existing driveways will be maintained as part of the Project. Both driveways
on Mitchell Avenue provide full access (i.e., they accommodate both left and right ingress and
egress turning movements). The driveway on Washington Place provides right-turn-out turning
movements only.


The westerly driveway on Mitchell Avenue provides access to the pick-up/drop-off area via
internal drive aisles that circulate the pick-up/drop-off area. This driveway operates as a two-
lane entrance to the Project Site. Vehicles can exit via the driveway located on Washington
Place, which provides right-turn egress only. These driveways are only open during morning
and afternoon student pick-up and drop-off periods. The easterly driveway on Mitchell Avenue
provides access to the site before and after the student pick-up/drop-off periods.




STUDENT PICK-UP AND DROP-OFF OPERATIONS

The School schedule consists of an 8:45 A.M. start time on Monday through Friday and a
staggered dismissal at 3:00 P.M. and 3:15 P.M. on Monday through Thursday and 1:45 P.M.
and 2:00 P.M. on Friday. Morning drop-off operations occur over a 30-minute period (i.e.,
between 8:15 and 8:45 A.M.), with the peak arrival occurring the 15 minutes prior to class start
time The student pick-up operations occur over a 30-minute period (i.e., between 3:00 and
3:30), with student pick-up completing 15 minutes after each dismissal time.


As shown in Figure 11, the student pick-up/drop-off area operates with one-way circulation with
vehicles entering via the westerly driveway on Mitchell Avenue and exiting via the driveway on
Washington Place. The pick-up/drop-off operations and circulation are facilitated by a group of




                                                                                              47
staff/teachers and a designated monitor. For drop-off or pick-up of students, parents may also
park on adjacent streets (Mitchell Avenue, Washington Place, Centinela Avenue, and Grand
View Boulevard) and walk onto the campus. The north side of Mitchell Avenue has restricted
parking limited to 15 minutes on school days which accommodates drop-off and pick-up
activities. Street parking on Washington Place, Centinela Avenue, and Grand View Boulevard is
generally unrestricted (some 4 hour parking restrictions). In addition, to accommodate drop-off
and pick-up parent walk-ins, as well as on-campus activities such as parent-teacher
conferences and class meetings, the school has a parking arrangement with the adjacent
Culver City Church of God at the corner of Centinela Avenue and Washington Place to allow up
to 28 cars to park on school days.


During the morning student drop-off period, parents enter the pick-up/drop-off area and pull
forward to the active loading spaces located adjacent to the sidewalk area near the classroom
buildings, where teachers and staff accompany students from the vehicle to the school
entrance. The afternoon student pick-up period operates with the same circulation as the
morning drop-off. Parents queue their vehicles in two lines in the pick-up/drop-off area until
student dismissal. Parents must have a name card listing each student in their carpool with
each student's designated pick-up time. When parents enter the pick-up/drop-off area, the
designated monitor calls out the students' names to come from their classrooms and wait for
their parents at the loading area. The teachers and staff then accompany each student to the
vehicles. Should parents arrive before their designated pick-up time, they will be rerouted out of
the pick-up/drop-off area by the designated monitor to minimize on-site vehicle queuing.


The pick-up/drop-off area allows for a queue of up to 20 vehicles (four active loading spaces
and 16 queuing area spaces), and provides two additional spaces for vehicles exiting the
Washington Place driveway, which minimizes queuing and congestion along Mitchell Avenue. It
is noted that Mitchell Avenue is in the City of Los Angeles, and Grand View Elementary School,
an L.A. Unified School District, is on the north side of Mitchell Avenue. Based on observations
of existing operations and established practices conducted at the School on January 31, 2011,
the student pick-up/drop-off operation runs efficiently with the current student enrollment at 300
students. In order to assess whether the existing queuing space will be sufficient to handle
future operations with a maximum of 400 students, a queuing analysis was conducted.




                                                                                                48
STUDENT PICK-UP/DROP-OFF QUEUEING ANALYSIS


An analysis of the school pick-up and drop-off operations was conducted to assess whether the
existing queuing space provides enough room to contain proposed pick-up and drop-off
operations within the School property. This analysis considered the number of vehicles arriving
to drop off or pick up students, the amount of time each vehicle would remain stopped, the
amount of vehicular queuing area provided within the pick-up/drop-off area, and the start and
dismissal times for the School.



Analysis Assumptions


The trip generation rate used to estimate the Project's net new trips for the additional 100
students (Table 7) was also used to estimate the number of trips generated for the Project's
maximum enrollment of 400 students. Thus, the total student population of 400 students is
estimated to generate a total of 200 inbound trips and 160 outbound trips during the morning
commuter peak hour and 112 inbound trips and 128 outbound trips during the afternoon
commuter peak hour. The morning and afternoon commuter peak periods generally coincide
with the morning student drop-off and afternoon student pick-up periods. The forecasted trips
represent all of the vehicles entering and exiting the Site during the morning and afternoon peak
hours that are associated with the school uses (i.e., faculty, staff, students, etc.) For the
purposes of a conservative analysis, the number of outbound vehicles during the morning peak
hour was assumed to represent the number of vehicles arriving for student drop-off and the
number of inbound vehicles during the afternoon peak hour was assumed to represent the
number of vehicles arriving for student pick-up. In general, the student morning drop-off period
was considered to be the time with the highest concentration of vehicles, rather than the student
afternoon pick-up period, when the vehicles picking up students are more spread out due to the
staggering of dismissal times and after school programs.


School peak hour arrival patterns are different than most land uses in that the arrivals are not
spread evenly throughout the peak hour, but are sharply bunched into the last 30 minutes before
class begins and the first 15 minutes after student dismissal. As described, the School schedule
consists of an 8:45 A.M. start time Monday through Friday and a staggered dismissal at 3:00
P.M. and 3:15 P.M. on Monday through Thursday and 1:45 P.M. and 2:00 P.M. on Friday.




                                                                                               49
Approximately half of the student enrollment (i.e., 200 students) is accommodated in the early
dismissal, with the remaining half in the late dismissal period.




Methodology

Vehicle queuing during the morning peak drop-off and afternoon peak pick-up periods was
analyzed using LADOT's "Reservoir Needs vs. Traffic Intensity" methodology, found in Appendix
B of Traffic Study Policies and Procedures. The methodology assumes arrivals follow a Poisson
Distribution and the service rate can be represented by an exponential probability function. After
determining the arrival rate and service rate, the traffic intensity can then be calculated by dividing
the arrival rate by the service rate. The traffic intensity is then matched to the total needed spaces
for vehicle queuing behind the four active loading spaces, as shown in Figure 12.




Determination of Required Storage Area

As shown in Table 12, it is assumed that 60% of the morning student drop-offs occur during the
30 minutes prior to the start of class and 60% of the afternoon student pick-ups occur during the
15 minutes after each class dismissal time. This results in 96 vehicles during the morning drop-off
peak period and 34 vehicles during each afternoon pick-up peak period. The estimated peak
arrival rate is 3.2 vehicles per minute during the morning peak period and 2.3 vehicles per minute
during each afternoon peak period.


A vehicle entering the site to drop off or pick up a child is expected to pull into the four active
loading spaces in the pick-up/drop-off area and stop to let the child out of or into the vehicle. It is
estimated that this can take approximately 60 seconds (one minute) during the morning drop-off
period and 90 seconds (1.5 minutes) during the afternoon pick-up period. It was assumed that
each drop-off space can accommodate one vehicle every 60 seconds during the morning peak
drop-off period and every 90 seconds during the afternoon pick-up period on average including
the time in between vehicles. This results in a service rate of 4.0 vehicles per minute during the
morning peak drop-off period and 2.7 vehicles per minute during each afternoon peak pick-up
period.




                                                                                                     50
The resulting traffic intensity was calculated to be 0.80 (3.2 vehicles per minute / 4.0 vehicles per
minute) for the morning peak drop-off period and 0.85 (2.3 vehicles per minute / 2.7 vehicles per
minute) during each afternoon pick-up period. As shown in Figure 12, the calculated traffic
intensity for the morning peak drop-off period and each afternoon peak pick-up period will require
six and eight spaces for vehicle queuing, respectively, behind the four active loading spaces.




Queuing Analysis Summary

There are 16 available spaces (eight vehicles per lane) within the vehicle queuing area provided
on-site. Therefore, it is anticipated that the pick-up/drop-off area can accommodate the queue
length during the morning peak drop-off period and each afternoon peak pick-up period for the
total of 400 students without any overflow queuing on Mitchell Avenue or any other adjacent
streets.

                                                        Summary and Conclusions


This study was undertaken to analyze the potential traffic impacts of Wildwood Lower School
Project on the local street system. The following summarizes the results of this analysis:


       The study conducted detailed traffic impact analysis at a total of seven study intersections.
       All seven of the study intersections operate at LOS D or better in both the morning and
       afternoon peak hours.

       The Project is expected to generate a total of approximately 90 morning peak hour trips
       and 60 afternoon peak hour trips on a typical weekday.

       Existing plus Project traffic conditions in the Study Area were tallied for the existing year
       of 2012. Analysis of projected Year 2012 Existing plus Project conditions indicates that,
       using the significance criteria established by the City of Culver City and LADOT, the
       Project is not anticipated to have a significant impact at any of the seven analyzed
       intersections during the morning or afternoon peak hours. Thus, no mitigation is
       recommended or required.

       Future traffic conditions in the Study Area were forecast for the Project buildout year of
       2020. Analysis of projected Future Plus Project (Year 2020) conditions indicates that,
       using the significance criteria established by the City of Culver City and LADOT, the
       proposed Project is not anticipated to have a significant impact at any of the seven
       analyzed intersections during the morning or afternoon peak hours Thus, no mitigation
       is recommended or required.

       Analysis of potential impacts on the regional transportation system conducted in
       accordance with CMP guidelines determined that the Project would not have a significant
       impact on the regional arterial system or the transit system.

       It is anticipated that the current student pick-up/drop-off operation will accommodate the
       additional traffic generated by the proposed increase in student enrollment, based on a
       review of the extents of the vehicular queuing area, observations conducted at the School,
       and efficient student pick-up/drop-off operations with the current student enrollment. The
       current student pick-up/drop-off practices will also be able to accommodate the queuing of
       the maximum Project enrollment of 400 students.
